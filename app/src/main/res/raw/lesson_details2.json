This solder is known as leaded solder. As it has come to be known, lead is harmful to humans and can lead to lead poisoning when exposed to large amounts. Unfortunately, lead is also a very useful metal, and it was chosen as the go-to metal for soldering because of its low melting point and ability to create great solder joints.\nWith the adverse effects of leaded soldering known, some key individuals and countries decided it was best to not use leaded solder anymore. In 2006, the European Union adopted the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive(RoHS). This directive, stated simply, restricts the use of leaded solder (amongst other materials) in electronics and electrical equipment. With that, the use of lead-free solder became the norm in electronics manufacturing.\n",

However, when it comes to you and your electronics, the choice of solder is yours to make. Many people still prefer the use of leaded solder on account of its superb ability to act as a joining agent. Still, others prefer safety over functionality and opt for the lead-free. SparkFun sells both varieties to allow individuals to make that choice for themselves.\nLead-free solder is not without its downfalls. As mentioned, lead was chosen because it performs the best in a situation such as soldering. When you take away the lead, you also take away some of the properties of solder that make it ideal for what it was intended – joining two pieces of metal. One such property is the melting point. Tin has a higher melting point than lead resulting in more heat needed to achieve flow. And, although tin gets the job done, it sometimes needs a little help. Many lead-free solder variants have what’s called a flux core. For now, just know that flux is a chemical agent that aids in the flowing of lead-free solder. While it is possible to use lead-free solder without flux, it makes it much easier to achieve the same effects as with leaded solder. Also, because of the added cost in making lead-free solder, it can sometimes be more expensive than leaded solder.\n",

Second, solder comes in a variety of gauges, or widths. When working with small components, it’s often better to use a very thin piece of solder – the larger then number, the smaller the gauge. For large components, thicker wire is recommended. Last, solder comes in other forms besides wire. When getting into surface-mount soldering, you’ll see that solder paste is the form of choice. However, since this is a through-hole soldering tutorial, solder paste will not be discussed in detail.\n\n",

Ensure that your workspace is well ventilated, and if you plan to be soldering for a long period of time, work with an exhaust fan when possible.\n\nProtecting Your Eyes. A lot of people skip protective eyewear, but safety goggles are an important part of any safe workspace. Spatter may be rare, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nKeeping Your Cool.Never forget that your soldering iron is hot! Once you’ve preheated the iron, make sure that you only hold it by the insulated grip, and always return it to its stand after you’ve used it.\n",

Spot the hazard\nA hazard is anything that could hurt you or someone else.\nExamples of workplace hazards include:\nfrayed electrical cords (could result in electrical shock)\nboxes stacked precariously (they could fall on someone)\nnoisy machinery (could result in damage to your hearing)\nDuring work experience, you must remain alert to anything that may be dangerous. If you see, hear or smell anything odd, take note. If you think it could be a hazard, tell someone.\n2. Assess the risk\nAssessing the risk means working out how likely it is that a hazard will harm someone and how serious the harm could be.\nWhenever you spot a hazard, assess the risk by asking yourself two questions:\nhow likely is it that the hazard could harm me or someone else?\nhow badly could I or someone else be harmed?\nAlways tell someone (your employer, your supervisor or your health and safety representative) about hazards you can't fix yourself, especially if the hazard could cause serious harm to anyone.\nFor example:\nask your supervisor for instructions and training before using equipment\nask for help moving or lifting heavy objects\ntell your supervisor if you think a work practice could be dangerous\nIf you are not sure of the safest way to do something on work experience, always ask your work experience supervisor.\n3. Make the changes\nIt is your employer's responsibility to fix hazards. Sometimes you may be able to fix simple hazards yourself, as long as you don't put yourself or others at risk. For example, you can pick up things from the floor and put them away to eliminate a trip hazard.\nThe best way to fix a hazard is to get rid of it altogether. This is not always possible, but your employer should try to make hazards less dangerous by looking at the following options (in order from most effective to least effective):\nElimination - Sometimes hazards - equipment, substances or work practices - can be avoided entirely. (e.g. Clean high windows from the ground with an extendable pole cleaner, rather than by climbing a ladder and risking a fall.)\nSubstitution - Sometimes a less hazardous thing, substance or work practice can be used. (e.g. Use a non-toxic glue instead of a toxic glue.)\nIsolation - Separate the hazard from people, by marking the hazardous area, fitting screens or putting up safety barriers. (e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\nSafeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\nInstructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\nUsing personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.",

As a result he came into contact with a live conductor and was killed. The company in question was found guilty of failing to provide the right equipment and fined $300,000 by the HSE.\nThe Electrical Safety Council, now renamed as Electrical Safety First, has produced a guidance document that covers the best practice for safe isolation and part of this guidance covers the test equipment that should be used. Using the right equipment is one of the most important parts of the procedure, as failure to do so can result in a circuit remaining live, resulting in injury or death.\nWhat equipment is required for safe isolation?\nThe Electrical Safety First Guidance states that \"…The point of isolation should be locked off using a unique key or combination retained by the person carrying out the work or the appointed person, and a caution notice attached to the point of isolation.\nWhere more than one operative is working on circuits supplied from an isolated distribution board, a multi-lock hasp can be used to prevent operation…\"\nLocking off kits are available to ensure you have all the necessary equipment to lock out the circuit being worked on\nhere are a number of kits available on the market, however a basic kit should include the following:",

The list of suitable equipment includes test lamps, such as the Drummond MTL10 or MTL20, or a two-pole voltage detector, such as the Martindale VI13800.\nIt is important to note that the voltage indicator must be able to work without the need for a battery, if you are using a device that needs a battery in order to work and the battery is flat, then you will not be able to prove if the circuit is dead or not!\nThe procedure for proving dead is to take your voltage indicator and check it against a known source, such as a proving unit, then test the circuit, then test your voltage indicator against your known source again to prove the tester has not failed during the test.\nWhilst you can use a known live source to test your voltage indicator, we would recommend using a dedicated proving unit. The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

The codes of practice provide guidance for electrical safety duties and standards required under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB). They also outline effective ways to identify and manage electrical safety risks.\nThe codes of practice deal with particular issues and do not cover every hazard or risk. You are required to consider all electrical safety risks, not just those outlined in the regulations and codes of practice. You should read the electrical safety codes of practice along with other codes of practice such as How to manage work health and safety risks - Code of practice 2011 (PDF, 594KB).\nFollowing the codes of practice generally means that you have achieved compliance in your workplace.\nCodes of practice can be used in court proceedings as the courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk or control. The courts may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\nThe Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB), supported by the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) and the 4 codes of practice contain information on how to identify and manage electrical safety risks. They can help you to make your workplace safer.\nThe Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) helps you to identify specific ways to meet your electrical safety duties under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB) and establishes requirements for:\nelectrical work\nelectrical licensing\nworking near overhead and underground electric lines\nelectrical installations\nin-scope electrical equipment\nworks of an electricity entity\nelectricity supply\nsafety management systems for prescribed electricity entities\ncathodic protection systems\nincident notification and reporting.\nIt is important to realise that the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) does not identify all that you need to do in order to fulfil your duties.",

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

    "content": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below. Usually alternating voltage and current are expressed in effective values rather than in peak-to-peak values.\n\nInstantaneous Value:The instantaneous value of an alternating voltage or current is the value of voltage or current at one particular instant. The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing. It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\n\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation.

    "content": "1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Many different types of power supplies are used in power amplifiers, but in the end they all basically aim to generate DC voltage for the transistor circuits of the unit. The very best of amplifiers have two totally independent power supplies, one for each channel  (they do share a common AC power cord though). Truly excellent amplifiers will also have a separate (or at least separately regulated) power supply for the input stage (those circuits that do not actually drive the speaker).  Under heavy load, the power supply voltage internal to the amp can sag (and this can lead to distortion).

For example, a siren driver is one application of a Class B amp. Siren drivers are amplifiers that are basically driven into clipping (to produce a square wave type signal).

Due to improvements in the speed, power capacity and efficiency of modern semiconductor devices, applications using Class D amps have become affordable for the common person. Class D amplifiers use a completely different method of amplification as compared to Class A, B and AB.  Whereas the aforementioned classes of amplifier operate the semiconductor devices in the linear mode, Class D amplifiers operate the output semiconductor devices as switches (ON or OFF).  In a Class D amplifier, the input signal is compared with a high frequency triangle wave, resulting in the generation of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) type signal.  This signal (which some people incorrectly identify as a “digital” signal) is then applied to a special filter that removes all the unwanted high frequency by-products of the PWM stage.  The output of the filter drives the speaker.  Please note that this is a VERY high level idea of how Class D amplifiers work! Class D amps are (today) most often found in car audio subwoofer amplifiers. The major advantage of Class D amplifiers is that they have the potential for very good efficiency (due to the fact that the semiconductor devices are ON or OFF in the power stage, resulting in low power dissipation in the device as compared to linear amplifier classes).  One notable disadvantage of Class D amplifiers: they are fairly complicated and special care is required in their design (to make them reliable).  Due to the high frequencies that are present in the audio signal (as a result of the PWM stage), Class D amps used for car stereo applications are often limited to subwoofer frequencies, however designs are improving all the time. It will not be too long before a full band class D amp becomes commonplace and less costly. Class D amps find use in many other applications besides audio.  Class D amplifiers will probably eventually revolutionize audio power amplifiers: when they are perfected, their efficiency will allow outputs of 1000+ watts without the need for a cooling fan!  They will also be small and lightweight compared to the class AB designs that are most common today",

At this time I will not go into the details of all of these other classes. Suffice to note that Class D (among A, B, AB, D, S, G, H classes) is the class that represents a major delta in the way it operates as compared to the other audio amplifier classes. Sometimes the consumer marketplace promotes Class D amplifiers as being \"digital\". The marketplace tends to toss around the word \"digital\" a lot, there is no really standardized definition (that I am aware of) that deems an amp \"digital\". To find out what a vendor means when they use the word digital with regard to an amp requires research into the design of the amp. Most likely the vendor is just using a buzz word that the consumer may associate with a superior technology.",

    "content": "Audio Power amplifiers are typically rated for \"8 ohm\" and \"4 ohm” loads, and more and more (the higher end pro amps) are also giving ratings for continuous operation using \"2 ohm\" loads (loads being speakers, you can see more info on this topic in my article on speakers). If you have ever looked at a spec sheet for a decent quality amplifier, you probably noticed that the power output of an amplifier is higher when the load impedance (number of ohms) is lower. Important: a load with a low number of ohms is a more difficult load than one with a higher number of ohms! That is, a 4 ohm speaker is harder for an amplifier to drive than an 8 ohm speaker. The performance capabilities of an amplifier when driving low impedance loads is closely related to the capabilities of its power supply.\nIf we had a perfect amplifier (and it was plugged into an outlet that had unlimited current capability), its output power rating would double each time the load impedance was halved. For example, let's say the amplifier puts out 200 watts per channel at 8 ohms. At 4 ohms, it would put out 400 watts per channel, at 2 ohms it would put out 800 watts per channel, and at 1 ohm it would put out 1600 watts per channel. For the perfect amplifier, one could keep going with this until the load impedance approached zero, at which time the amplifier output would approach infinity! On the other side, if the load impedance was 16 ohms, the amplifier would put out only 100 watts per channel. In this direction, one could keep raising the load impedance, and the power output would grow smaller and smaller.\nThe power supply of the perfect amplifier generates a DC voltage that does not change no matter how much current is demanded from it. This means that the perfect amplifier can drive an unlimited number of speakers. In the real world, amplifiers have real power supplies which do have limits as to how much current they deliver (and real world amps use output devices that are only rated for so much current before they self destruct). For such typical amplifiers, the 4 ohm power rating is usually about 50% more than the 8 ohm rating (and if a 2 ohm rating is given, this is maybe double that of the 8 ohm rating). Amplifiers with exceptional power supply designs will do better than this, but eventually a limit will be reached (if by nothing else the AC outlet can only deliver so much current!). Lesser designs will \"run out of juice” when driving the heavier loads. Most decent amplifier spec sheets will specify how much power the amp can deliver into various load impedances.  If an amp’s spec sheet gives a 8 and 4 ohm rating, be careful before using the amp with 2 ohm loads.  It might work, but more likely it will be stressed out and may overheat or fail prematurely.  \nAmplifiers utilizing exceptional power supply designs will invariably be the more expensive units available, and possibly the (physically) heavier designs. This is because good power supply designs usually require heavier and better (low loss) \"magnetics\". All power supplies utilize some combination of transformers, rectifiers, capacitors, and in the case of some so called \"digital\" amplifiers, switching components.",

A control circuit monitors the output voltage of this stage and makes adjustments to the switching circuit \"on the fly” in order to keep the final DC output voltage as close to the design value as possible. So, the advantages of lighter weight and smaller size come at the expense of increased parts count (which ultimately might translate to less reliability if the parts are of lesser quality). Switching power supplies tend to generate a lot more electronic noise as compared to linear power supplies (discriminating audiophiles would almost never tolerate a switching power supply in the audio path).  Also, switching power supplies are harder to repair if they fail.",

    "content": "Many of the better amplifiers on the market today are touting excellent performance with 2 ohm load impedances. Some also state that \"continuous operation\" with 2 ohm loads is possible. While such statements are probably true, it may not be a good idea to operate the amplifier under such conditions!\nEven though an amplifier may be rated for continuous use at 2ohms, there are several reasons why this may not be the best thing to do:\nParalleled speaker loads may be lower than you think: No speakers that DJ's are likely to use have 2ohm ratings. However, a pair of 4 ohm speakers paralleled will yield a nominal 2 ohm rating. As stated before, the actual impedance varies and the minimum impedance may dip considerably below 2 ohms at certain frequencies. Lower impedance loads mean more losses and more heat dissipation in the amplifier (see next item). \nHeat Considerations: Operating an amplifier with a low impedance load (especially a low impedance reactive load) increases the heat dissipation of the amplifier (try it if you don't believe it!). This is because low impedance loads require more current, which taxes the amplifier’s power supply more severely. More current means more losses (which translates to more heat both in the power supply and output stage devices). Excessive heat is unhealthy for electronic devices and should be avoided. \nIncreased Line Losses: As the speaker impedance is lowered, more of the audio signal is lost (in the form of heat) in the speaker cables! This can become significant if you run long cables. Speaker wires have resistance (the value depends on the thickness and length of the cable); if the speaker impedance becomes very low the resistance of the speaker wire may no longer be insignificant. To prevent this problem, the cross sectional area of the speaker cable conductor must double for each halving of speaker load impedance! In other words, running 2 ohm loads means using VERY heavy speaker cables (especially so if they are of significant length) in order to avoid losing costly audio power in the speaker cables. \nDamping Factor degradation: Using super low impedance loads on an amplifier will degrade the system's damping factor (discussed in detail below). Degradation of damping factor means that the amplifier will have less \"control\" over the speaker system, possibly resulting in a degradation of the sound quality.",

    "content": "Clipping is a term which many people have probably heard, but may not fully understand. Very simply, clipping of an amplifier occurs when one tries to get a larger output signal out of an amplifier than it was designed to provide.\nAs stated before, all power amplifiers have a DC power supply which provides power to (among other things) the output stage of the amplifier. For most amplifiers, the power supply consists of a \"plus\" supply and a \"minus\" supply. The two voltages are often referred to as \"rail voltages\" or simply \"rails\". As an example, a 200 wpc amplifier (at 8 ohms) might have a power supply voltage (rails) of +/- 60 volts DC. This means that the output voltage which drives the speaker can never exceed + 60 or - 60 volts. If the amplifier is playing at near full volume, and someone “cranks up the volume”, the amplifier will attempt to put out more power. However, the power required to meet the sudden new demand for more volume cannot be met by the power supply voltage, which has limits of +/-60 volts in this example. The result is a waveform with the top portion (or peak) \"clipped\" off (hence the term \"clipping\"). Such clipping represents a distortion which is added to the waveform (and if it is severe enough it will be clearly audible). If a signal is severely clipped, the waveform takes on the shape of a \"square wave\", and the resulting sound will be absolutely hideous. Clipping can be easily observed using an oscilloscope attached to the amplifier output.",

It is no longer a two channel (stereo) amp as far as input signals and loads are concerned. If you have two speakers and want to use bridged amplifiers in a stereo mode, you will need two stereo amplifiers (one stereo amplifier for each input channel). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode accept a single input signal. Normally, the input will be \"Channel 1\" or \"left\". Manufacturers vary however, so check the instruction manual for the proper input wiring procedures. \nIf the amp you want to run in bridged mode does not have built in facilities for doing so, you should not attempt to use it in this manner (unless you are thoroughly sure of what you are doing). A blown amp could result if you make a mistake or bad assumption.\nIf you run bridged amplifiers, you must pay close attention to speaker wiring phasing, otherwise, you may have \"hollow\" or \"weak\" sound. The speaker cable connection in bridged mode connects to the two positive (usually red) speaker connection terminals on the amplifier (the ground (black) connections are not used). The manufacturer will state which red terminal is really the \"positive\" connection.  The speaker won’t care about phasing, but you (normally) want all your speakers phased the same (otherwise they will tend to cancel each other out and result in less sound).\nThe speaker output signals of a bridged amplifier are floating; such connections must never be connected to any grounded device (such as an external accessory power meter, for example). If you do make such an illegal connection, one amplifier channel is basically short circuited (worst case result is a blown amplifier!). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode are usually capable of doing so only with speakers that have impedance of twice the minimum impedance the amp is rated for when in normal mode. In other words, if an amp is rated to handle 4 ohm loads in normal mode, in general the minimum load for bridged mode will be 8 ohms. Check your amp's specifications for details. ",

    "content": "Bi-amplification is (in most cases) defined as using more than one amplifier to power a speaker system (typically one amp for bass and one for mid/high frequencies). The key point here is that each amplifier is dedicated to a specific frequency band (whereas with single amplifier systems the one amp covers the entire audio range).  Similarly, some systems are tri-amplified and once in a while you may see a 4 or 5 way system (although the latter is usually reserved for only the most powerful touring type sound systems). Bi-amplification has many significant benefits:\nLower Distortion By using a separate amp for bass and a separate amp for mid/highs, the bass amp can clip without adversely impacting the overall sound quality. Chances are that the ugly sounding distortion produced by clipping an amp will not sound as bad coming out of a woofer (because woofers don't reproduce the high frequency distortion signals very well). Note that this means you should not consider clipping a good thing, it's just that the impact won't be as bad. \nMore total output Let's say you have a 400 watt single amp and 300 watt bass amp and 100 watt high/mid amp for use in a bi-amped configuration. You will be (in most cases) be able to get a higher volume out of the bi-amped system as compared to the single 400 watt system. Why is this? Isn't the total power the same for both setups? It is. However, due to the nature of musical waveforms, you'll be better able to handle large peak signals better. For example a loud bass sound and a loud HF sound at the same time may require a signal level that would clip the 400 watt amp. However, because in the bi-amp system the signal is split into different frequency bands, there's a better chance of handling the signal without clipping. Note that you can't expect to get a large amount of increase in sound level by using bi-amped systems, but in general you will get somewhat more capacity and at the same time significantly reduced levels of distortion. \nBetter Crossover performance The bad news is that bi-amplification requires that the signals to the amps be split into low and high bands BEFORE they are input to the amp. This requires what is called an \"electronic\" or \"active\" crossover network. The bad news is that this means more money, more wiring and more chances for problems if you don’t hook it up correctly.  However, the advantages of a bi or tri amped system make it the only choice for high power high performance systems.  Using an electronic crossover eliminates the need for large, expensive, lossy and non linear passive low frequency crossovers in bass systems. Elimination of passive crossovers (in the speaker cabinets) can significantly increase the quality of the sound!  Also, it is easy to design steep slope crossovers using active electronics, allowing for very sharp cutoff of lows and highs (a good thing for HF systems). Also, most active crossovers allow one to adjust the crossover frequency, adjust the level of the signal and vary the phase. For high power systems, bi-amplification is the norm (and tri-amplification is not at all uncommon). ",

    "content": "To begin with, the actual image presented in color television systems can be described using two components: Luminance and Chrominance. \nLuminance is a weighted sum of the three colors of light used in color television and computer displays - which are Red, Green and Blue - at a given point on the screen. A stronger Luminance signal indicates a more intense brightness of light at a given spot on the screen. \nChrominance describes the frequency of light at a given point on the screen, or in more common terms, the color of the light to be produced at a given point. The Chrominance signal specifies what color is to be shown at a given point on the display as well as how saturated or intense the shade of color that is shown. Combinations of Red, Green and Blue light produced by the video display are able to deceive the human eye into perceiving the full range of visible colors, even though only three narrow ranges of frequencies in the visible spectrum can actually be generated by the video display. (This is reasonable, since the human eye only detects light frequencies centered around what we perceive as Red, Green and Blue, although human sensitivity to wavelengths of light is greater than the narrow wavelengths that the typical video display generates.) \nTogether, Luminance indicates how bright a given location on the screen is, and Chrominance specifies how close to not having a color (just being \"White\"), or how intense the shade of color at the brightness specified by the Luminance should be.",

    "content": "The image in NTSC Television is transmitted using three components. The first and most important is the Luminance (which is known simply as \"Y\"). As described above, Luminance specifies how bright a given spot on the display should be, and is the only signal used on black and white displays or receivers. \nThe additional components transmitted are known simply as \"I\" and \"Q\". These contain combinations of the Red, Green and Blue information to describe the color or Chrominance that should appear on the given spot on the screen. The combination of Y, I and Q signals are used by the NTSC color television receiver to recover Red, Green and Blue signals that are to be sent to the Cathode Ray Tube or other types of display electronics. \nTo most people, the NTSC transmission system seems somewhat convoluted, and many people wonder why the separate Red, Green and Blue signals aren't just sent as is, like they are in the television studio or in computer video equipment. The main reason is that black and white television already existed when color television was being developed, and there was a strong desire to come up with a system that remained compatible with the Luminance signal transmission system that millions of existing black and white television receivers already had.",

    "content": "To compute the Luminance signal (which is known as \"Y\"), circuitry at the television station or transmitter takes Red, Green and Blue signals from the television camera or other equipment and generates Y using this formula: \nY Luminance = (Red x 0.30) + (Green x 0.59) + (Blue x 0.11) \nThis weighting is also built into the circuitry of the video graphics circuitry in computer video systems so that it should be impossible to have the total of signal strength emitted by a video card exceed 100%. This means that when a color is specified in computer software or in HTML, an increment of one for the setting for Green brightness causes a much larger increase in overall brightness on the display than an increment of one in the Red or Blue colors. \n(Note: Some televisions and computer monitors allow you to deviate from these values slightly by changing the \"Color Temperature\". Web page designers should avoid designing colors based on any custom temperature settings that they may have set on their own monitor.) \nThe other two signals that are transmitted by a television station that are used to represent Chrominance (color) are generated using these formulas: \nQ Signal = (Red x 0.21) - (Green x 0.52) + (Blue x 0.31) \nI Signal = (Red x 0.60) - (Green x 0.28) - (Blue x 0.32) \nHere is a set of standard NTSC \"color bars\", followed by \"luminance bars\". If both sets of bars were displayed on a black and white display, the shades of gray in each vertical column would be identical. In other words, the area that appears as Green, when shown on a black and white monitor, would appear as the same shade of gray as that which appears directly below the Green color. This is because each shade of Gray that is shown has the same level of Luminance as the color directly above. The luminance bars merely lack the Chrominance component. \nThe numerical values that create each color or luminance shade in NTSC television are shown, as well as what the the equivalent computer display settings are.

How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "content": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "content": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "content": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

It is used with an antenna. The antenna intercepts radio waves (electromagnetic waves) and converts them to tiny alternating currents which are applied to the receiver, and the receiver extracts the desired information. The receiver uses electronic filters to separate the desired radio frequency signal from all the other signals picked up by the antenna, an electronic amplifier to increase the power of the signal for further processing, and finally recovers the desired information through demodulation.\nThe information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound, images, or data.[1] A radio receiver may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. Radio receivers are components of communications, broadcasting, remote control, and network systems. In consumer electronics, the terms radio and radio receiver are often used specifically for receivers designed to reproduce sound transmitted by radio broadcasting stations, historically the first mass-market commercial radio application.",

Spot the hazard\nA hazard is anything that could hurt you or someone else.\nExamples of workplace hazards include:\nfrayed electrical cords (could result in electrical shock)\nboxes stacked precariously (they could fall on someone)\nnoisy machinery (could result in damage to your hearing)\nDuring work experience, you must remain alert to anything that may be dangerous. If you see, hear or smell anything odd, take note. If you think it could be a hazard, tell someone.\n2. Assess the risk\nAssessing the risk means working out how likely it is that a hazard will harm someone and how serious the harm could be.\nWhenever you spot a hazard, assess the risk by asking yourself two questions:\nhow likely is it that the hazard could harm me or someone else?\nhow badly could I or someone else be harmed?\nAlways tell someone (your employer, your supervisor or your health and safety representative) about hazards you can't fix yourself, especially if the hazard could cause serious harm to anyone.\nFor example:\nask your supervisor for instructions and training before using equipment\nask for help moving or lifting heavy objects\ntell your supervisor if you think a work practice could be dangerous\nIf you are not sure of the safest way to do something on work experience, always ask your work experience supervisor.\n3. Make the changes\nIt is your employer's responsibility to fix hazards. Sometimes you may be able to fix simple hazards yourself, as long as you don't put yourself or others at risk. For example, you can pick up things from the floor and put them away to eliminate a trip hazard.\nThe best way to fix a hazard is to get rid of it altogether. This is not always possible, but your employer should try to make hazards less dangerous by looking at the following options (in order from most effective to least effective):\nElimination - Sometimes hazards - equipment, substances or work practices - can be avoided entirely. (e.g. Clean high windows from the ground with an extendable pole cleaner, rather than by climbing a ladder and risking a fall.)\nSubstitution - Sometimes a less hazardous thing, substance or work practice can be used. (e.g. Use a non-toxic glue instead of a toxic glue.)\nIsolation - Separate the hazard from people, by marking the hazardous area, fitting screens or putting up safety barriers. (e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\nSafeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\nInstructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\nUsing personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.",

The list of suitable equipment includes test lamps, such as the Drummond MTL10 or MTL20, or a two-pole voltage detector, such as the Martindale VI13800.\nIt is important to note that the voltage indicator must be able to work without the need for a battery, if you are using a device that needs a battery in order to work and the battery is flat, then you will not be able to prove if the circuit is dead or not!\nThe procedure for proving dead is to take your voltage indicator and check it against a known source, such as a proving unit, then test the circuit, then test your voltage indicator against your known source again to prove the tester has not failed during the test.\nWhilst you can use a known live source to test your voltage indicator, we would recommend using a dedicated proving unit. The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

The codes of practice provide guidance for electrical safety duties and standards required under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB). They also outline effective ways to identify and manage electrical safety risks.\nThe codes of practice deal with particular issues and do not cover every hazard or risk. You are required to consider all electrical safety risks, not just those outlined in the regulations and codes of practice. You should read the electrical safety codes of practice along with other codes of practice such as How to manage work health and safety risks - Code of practice 2011 (PDF, 594KB).\nFollowing the codes of practice generally means that you have achieved compliance in your workplace.\nCodes of practice can be used in court proceedings as the courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk or control. The courts may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\nThe Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB), supported by the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) and the 4 codes of practice contain information on how to identify and manage electrical safety risks. They can help you to make your workplace safer.\nThe Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) helps you to identify specific ways to meet your electrical safety duties under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB) and establishes requirements for:\nelectrical work\nelectrical licensing\nworking near overhead and underground electric lines\nelectrical installations\nin-scope electrical equipment\nworks of an electricity entity\nelectricity supply\nsafety management systems for prescribed electricity entities\ncathodic protection systems\nincident notification and reporting.\nIt is important to realise that the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) does not identify all that you need to do in order to fulfil your duties.",

And I know that the voltage out from a voltage divider is a result of the values of those resistors. \nI also know that the resistance of an LDR varies with the amount of light it receives.

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

    "content": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below.

The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing.

    "content": "1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

    "content": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

It is named for the metal of which the device was historically commonly made, and the use of it is generally called ironing. Ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in polymer fiber materials. With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials, such as cotton, require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Many materials developed in the twentieth century are advertised as needing little or no ironing.",

    "content": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "content": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "content": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "content": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

As a result he came into contact with a live conductor and was killed. The company in question was found guilty of failing to provide the right equipment and fined $300,000 by the HSE.\nThe Electrical Safety Council, now renamed as Electrical Safety First, has produced a guidance document that covers the best practice for safe isolation and part of this guidance covers the test equipment that should be used. Using the right equipment is one of the most important parts of the procedure, as failure to do so can result in a circuit remaining live, resulting in injury or death.\nWhat equipment is required for safe isolation?\nThe Electrical Safety First Guidance states that \"…The point of isolation should be locked off using a unique key or combination retained by the person carrying out the work or the appointed person, and a caution notice attached to the point of isolation.\nWhere more than one operative is working on circuits supplied from an isolated distribution board, a multi-lock hasp can be used to prevent operation…\"\nLocking off kits are available to ensure you have all the necessary equipment to lock out the circuit being worked on\nhere are a number of kits available on the market, however a basic kit should include the following:",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

And I know that the voltage out from a voltage divider is a result of the values of those resistors. \nI also know that the resistance of an LDR varies with the amount of light it receives. This means that the voltage out, i.e. the voltage on the base of the transistor, will vary with the amount of light detected by the LDR.\nThen I look at the transistor. I know that the transistor can be turned on and off by applying a voltage at the base. So from this information, I would have an idea that this circuit will turn on and off the LED connected to the transistor, based on the amount of light the LDR receives.\nBUT, if you are a beginner and you don’t know what an LDR is, what a transistor is or what a voltage divider is, then you won’t have the foundation to understand the circuit. So you need to start by learning those parts first before you can understand the circuit diagram.",

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

Knowing two items in this equation allows you to calculate the third.\nDC circuits can be arranged in different ways. If component current has only one path to follow, it is connected in series. If there are two or more paths, the components are connected in parallel. Components may also be interconnected to provide both situations. These are called series-parallel combinations. \nThis course explains the DC circuits in simplified text and will be extremely helpful to individuals who require a basic knowledge of electrical principals and equipment to better their primary responsibilities \nThe DC circuits can be arranged in series, parallel and series-parallel combination circuits.

    "content": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing.

Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Many different types of power supplies are used in power amplifiers, but in the end they all basically aim to generate DC voltage for the transistor circuits of the unit. The very best of amplifiers have two totally independent power supplies, one for each channel  (they do share a common AC power cord though). Truly excellent amplifiers will also have a separate (or at least separately regulated) power supply for the input stage (those circuits that do not actually drive the speaker).  Under heavy load, the power supply voltage internal to the amp can sag (and this can lead to distortion).

Balanced inputs are much preferred over single ended inputs when interconnection cables are long and/or subject to noisy electrical environments because they provide very good noise rejection.

Due to improvements in the speed, power capacity and efficiency of modern semiconductor devices, applications using Class D amps have become affordable for the common person. Class D amplifiers use a completely different method of amplification as compared to Class A, B and AB.  Whereas the aforementioned classes of amplifier operate the semiconductor devices in the linear mode, Class D amplifiers operate the output semiconductor devices as switches (ON or OFF).  In a Class D amplifier, the input signal is compared with a high frequency triangle wave, resulting in the generation of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) type signal.  This signal (which some people incorrectly identify as a “digital” signal) is then applied to a special filter that removes all the unwanted high frequency by-products of the PWM stage.  The output of the filter drives the speaker.  Please note that this is a VERY high level idea of how Class D amplifiers work! Class D amps are (today) most often found in car audio subwoofer amplifiers. The major advantage of Class D amplifiers is that they have the potential for very good efficiency (due to the fact that the semiconductor devices are ON or OFF in the power stage, resulting in low power dissipation in the device as compared to linear amplifier classes).  One notable disadvantage of Class D amplifiers: they are fairly complicated and special care is required in their design (to make them reliable).  Due to the high frequencies that are present in the audio signal (as a result of the PWM stage), Class D amps used for car stereo applications are often limited to subwoofer frequencies, however designs are improving all the time. It will not be too long before a full band class D amp becomes commonplace and less costly. Class D amps find use in many other applications besides audio.  Class D amplifiers will probably eventually revolutionize audio power amplifiers: when they are perfected, their efficiency will allow outputs of 1000+ watts without the need for a cooling fan!  They will also be small and lightweight compared to the class AB designs that are most common today",

At this time I will not go into the details of all of these other classes. Suffice to note that Class D (among A, B, AB, D, S, G, H classes) is the class that represents a major delta in the way it operates as compared to the other audio amplifier classes.

The marketplace tends to toss around the word \"digital\" a lot, there is no really standardized definition (that I am aware of) that deems an amp \"digital\".

    "content": "Audio Power amplifiers are typically rated for \"8 ohm\" and \"4 ohm” loads, and more and more (the higher end pro amps) are also giving ratings for continuous operation using \"2 ohm\" loads (loads being speakers, you can see more info on this topic in my article on speakers). If you have ever looked at a spec sheet for a decent quality amplifier, you probably noticed that the power output of an amplifier is higher when the load impedance (number of ohms) is lower. Important: a load with a low number of ohms is a more difficult load than one with a higher number of ohms! That is, a 4 ohm speaker is harder for an amplifier to drive than an 8 ohm speaker. The performance capabilities of an amplifier when driving low impedance loads is closely related to the capabilities of its power supply.\nIf we had a perfect amplifier (and it was plugged into an outlet that had unlimited current capability), its output power rating would double each time the load impedance was halved. For example, let's say the amplifier puts out 200 watts per channel at 8 ohms. At 4 ohms, it would put out 400 watts per channel, at 2 ohms it would put out 800 watts per channel, and at 1 ohm it would put out 1600 watts per channel. For the perfect amplifier, one could keep going with this until the load impedance approached zero, at which time the amplifier output would approach infinity! On the other side, if the load impedance was 16 ohms, the amplifier would put out only 100 watts per channel. In this direction, one could keep raising the load impedance, and the power output would grow smaller and smaller.\nThe power supply of the perfect amplifier generates a DC voltage that does not change no matter how much current is demanded from it. This means that the perfect amplifier can drive an unlimited number of speakers. In the real world, amplifiers have real power supplies which do have limits as to how much current they deliver (and real world amps use output devices that are only rated for so much current before they self destruct). For such typical amplifiers, the 4 ohm power rating is usually about 50% more than the 8 ohm rating (and if a 2 ohm rating is given, this is maybe double that of the 8 ohm rating). Amplifiers with exceptional power supply designs will do better than this, but eventually a limit will be reached (if by nothing else the AC outlet can only deliver so much current!). Lesser designs will \"run out of juice” when driving the heavier loads. Most decent amplifier spec sheets will specify how much power the amp can deliver into various load impedances.  If an amp’s spec sheet gives a 8 and 4 ohm rating, be careful before using the amp with 2 ohm loads.  It might work, but more likely it will be stressed out and may overheat or fail prematurely.  \nAmplifiers utilizing exceptional power supply designs will invariably be the more expensive units available, and possibly the (physically) heavier designs. This is because good power supply designs usually require heavier and better (low loss) \"magnetics\". All power supplies utilize some combination of transformers, rectifiers, capacitors, and in the case of some so called \"digital\" amplifiers, switching components.",

So, the advantages of lighter weight and smaller size come at the expense of increased parts count (which ultimately might translate to less reliability if the parts are of lesser quality). Switching power supplies tend to generate a lot more electronic noise as compared to linear power supplies (discriminating audiophiles would almost never tolerate a switching power supply in the audio path).  Also, switching power supplies are harder to repair if they fail.",

    "content": "Many of the better amplifiers on the market today are touting excellent performance with 2 ohm load impedances. Some also state that \"continuous operation\" with 2 ohm loads is possible. While such statements are probably true, it may not be a good idea to operate the amplifier under such conditions!\nEven though an amplifier may be rated for continuous use at 2ohms, there are several reasons why this may not be the best thing to do:\nParalleled speaker loads may be lower than you think: No speakers that DJ's are likely to use have 2ohm ratings. However, a pair of 4 ohm speakers paralleled will yield a nominal 2 ohm rating. As stated before, the actual impedance varies and the minimum impedance may dip considerably below 2 ohms at certain frequencies. Lower impedance loads mean more losses and more heat dissipation in the amplifier (see next item). \nHeat Considerations: Operating an amplifier with a low impedance load (especially a low impedance reactive load) increases the heat dissipation of the amplifier (try it if you don't believe it!). This is because low impedance loads require more current, which taxes the amplifier’s power supply more severely. More current means more losses (which translates to more heat both in the power supply and output stage devices). Excessive heat is unhealthy for electronic devices and should be avoided. \nIncreased Line Losses: As the speaker impedance is lowered, more of the audio signal is lost (in the form of heat) in the speaker cables! This can become significant if you run long cables. Speaker wires have resistance (the value depends on the thickness and length of the cable); if the speaker impedance becomes very low the resistance of the speaker wire may no longer be insignificant. To prevent this problem, the cross sectional area of the speaker cable conductor must double for each halving of speaker load impedance! In other words, running 2 ohm loads means using VERY heavy speaker cables (especially so if they are of significant length) in order to avoid losing costly audio power in the speaker cables. \nDamping Factor degradation: Using super low impedance loads on an amplifier will degrade the system's damping factor (discussed in detail below). Degradation of damping factor means that the amplifier will have less \"control\" over the speaker system, possibly resulting in a degradation of the sound quality.",

    "content": "Clipping is a term which many people have probably heard, but may not fully understand. Very simply, clipping of an amplifier occurs when one tries to get a larger output signal out of an amplifier than it was designed to provide.\nAs stated before, all power amplifiers have a DC power supply which provides power to (among other things) the output stage of the amplifier. For most amplifiers, the power supply consists of a \"plus\" supply and a \"minus\" supply. The two voltages are often referred to as \"rail voltages\" or simply \"rails\". As an example, a 200 wpc amplifier (at 8 ohms) might have a power supply voltage (rails) of +/- 60 volts DC. This means that the output voltage which drives the speaker can never exceed + 60 or - 60 volts. If the amplifier is playing at near full volume, and someone “cranks up the volume”, the amplifier will attempt to put out more power. However, the power required to meet the sudden new demand for more volume cannot be met by the power supply voltage, which has limits of +/-60 volts in this example. The result is a waveform with the top portion (or peak) \"clipped\" off (hence the term \"clipping\"). Such clipping represents a distortion which is added to the waveform (and if it is severe enough it will be clearly audible). If a signal is severely clipped, the waveform takes on the shape of a \"square wave\", and the resulting sound will be absolutely hideous. Clipping can be easily observed using an oscilloscope attached to the amplifier output.",

It is no longer a two channel (stereo) amp as far as input signals and loads are concerned. If you have two speakers and want to use bridged amplifiers in a stereo mode, you will need two stereo amplifiers (one stereo amplifier for each input channel). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode accept a single input signal. Normally, the input will be \"Channel 1\" or \"left\". Manufacturers vary however, so check the instruction manual for the proper input wiring procedures. \nIf the amp you want to run in bridged mode does not have built in facilities for doing so, you should not attempt to use it in this manner (unless you are thoroughly sure of what you are doing). A blown amp could result if you make a mistake or bad assumption.\nIf you run bridged amplifiers, you must pay close attention to speaker wiring phasing, otherwise, you may have \"hollow\" or \"weak\" sound. The speaker cable connection in bridged mode connects to the two positive (usually red) speaker connection terminals on the amplifier (the ground (black) connections are not used). The manufacturer will state which red terminal is really the \"positive\" connection.  The speaker won’t care about phasing, but you (normally) want all your speakers phased the same (otherwise they will tend to cancel each other out and result in less sound).\nThe speaker output signals of a bridged amplifier are floating; such connections must never be connected to any grounded device (such as an external accessory power meter, for example). If you do make such an illegal connection, one amplifier channel is basically short circuited (worst case result is a blown amplifier!). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode are usually capable of doing so only with speakers that have impedance of twice the minimum impedance the amp is rated for when in normal mode. In other words, if an amp is rated to handle 4 ohm loads in normal mode, in general the minimum load for bridged mode will be 8 ohms. Check your amp's specifications for details. ",

    "content": "Bi-amplification is (in most cases) defined as using more than one amplifier to power a speaker system (typically one amp for bass and one for mid/high frequencies). The key point here is that each amplifier is dedicated to a specific frequency band (whereas with single amplifier systems the one amp covers the entire audio range).  Similarly, some systems are tri-amplified and once in a while you may see a 4 or 5 way system (although the latter is usually reserved for only the most powerful touring type sound systems). Bi-amplification has many significant benefits:\nLower Distortion By using a separate amp for bass and a separate amp for mid/highs, the bass amp can clip without adversely impacting the overall sound quality. Chances are that the ugly sounding distortion produced by clipping an amp will not sound as bad coming out of a woofer (because woofers don't reproduce the high frequency distortion signals very well). Note that this means you should not consider clipping a good thing, it's just that the impact won't be as bad. \nMore total output Let's say you have a 400 watt single amp and 300 watt bass amp and 100 watt high/mid amp for use in a bi-amped configuration. You will be (in most cases) be able to get a higher volume out of the bi-amped system as compared to the single 400 watt system. Why is this? Isn't the total power the same for both setups? It is. However, due to the nature of musical waveforms, you'll be better able to handle large peak signals better. For example a loud bass sound and a loud HF sound at the same time may require a signal level that would clip the 400 watt amp. However, because in the bi-amp system the signal is split into different frequency bands, there's a better chance of handling the signal without clipping. Note that you can't expect to get a large amount of increase in sound level by using bi-amped systems, but in general you will get somewhat more capacity and at the same time significantly reduced levels of distortion. \nBetter Crossover performance The bad news is that bi-amplification requires that the signals to the amps be split into low and high bands BEFORE they are input to the amp. This requires what is called an \"electronic\" or \"active\" crossover network. The bad news is that this means more money, more wiring and more chances for problems if you don’t hook it up correctly.  However, the advantages of a bi or tri amped system make it the only choice for high power high performance systems.  Using an electronic crossover eliminates the need for large, expensive, lossy and non linear passive low frequency crossovers in bass systems. Elimination of passive crossovers (in the speaker cabinets) can significantly increase the quality of the sound!  Also, it is easy to design steep slope crossovers using active electronics, allowing for very sharp cutoff of lows and highs (a good thing for HF systems). Also, most active crossovers allow one to adjust the crossover frequency, adjust the level of the signal and vary the phase. For high power systems, bi-amplification is the norm (and tri-amplification is not at all uncommon). ",

These stray electrons influence the voltage of the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise.\nTo compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.\nMany noise reduction algorithms tend to damage more or less signals.

A stronger Luminance signal indicates a more intense brightness of light at a given spot on the screen. \nChrominance describes the frequency of light at a given point on the screen, or in more common terms, the color of the light to be produced at a given point.

How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought.

For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "content": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "content": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "content": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

Lamps and other appliances are connected in parallel so that each of the appliances can be controlled individually. When a connection is required at a light or switch, the feed conductor is looped in by bringing it directly to the terminal and then carrying it forward again to the next point to be fed.\nThe switch and light feeds are carried round the circuit in a series of loops from one point to another until the last on the circuit is reached. The phase or line conductors are looped either in switchboard or box and neutrals are looped either in switchboard or from light or fan. Line or phase should never be looped from light or fan.",
