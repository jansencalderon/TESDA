Most people have heard of ergonomics and think it is something to do with seating or with the design of car controls and instruments – and it is… but it is so much more. Ergonomics applies to the design of anything that involves people – workspaces, sports and leisure, health and safety.\nErgonomics aims to improve workspaces and environments to minimize risk of injury or harm. So as technologies change, so too does the need to ensure that the tools we access for work, rest and play are designed for our body’s requirements.\r\nAccording to Safe Work Australia, the total economic cost of work-related injuries and illnesses is estimated to be $60 billion dollars. Recent research has shown that lower back pain is the world’s most common work-related disability – affecting employees from offices, building sites and in the highest risk category, agriculture.\r\n",

The data were gathered through an interview with household members using open-ended questions. Interviews were also conducted with garbage collectors as well as scavengers. Results showed that the households generated an \naverage of 3.2 kg of solid waste per day, or 0.50 kg/capita/day. The types of wastes commonly generated are food/kitchen wastes, papers, PET bottles, metals, and cans, boxes/cartons, glass bottles, cellophane/plastics, and yard/garden wastes. The respondents segregate their wastes into PET bottles, glass bottles, and other waste (mixed wastes). No respondents perform composting. It is worth noting, however, that burning of waste is not done by the respondents. The households rely on garbage collection by the government. Collection is done twice daily, except Sundays, and household members bring their garbage when the garbage truck arrives. However, there are those who dump their garbage in non – designated pick-up points, usually in a corner of the street. The dumped garbage becomes a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms. Some household respondents said that it is possible that the dumping in certain areas caused the dengue fever suffered by some of their family members. Mothers and household helpers are responsible for household waste management. ",

    "body": "Poorly designed hand tools — too heavy, poorly balanced, with a grip that is too large, the wrong shape, or slippery — can lead to injuries of the hand, wrist, forearm, shoulder, and neck. Here are the guidelines in selecting the right tool.\nGrip – a well-balanced tool with a properly designed grip or handle instantly feels comfortable in the hand. If a tool is poorly designed or is not right for the job, it may have to be held more firmly and at an awkward angle. A properly designed grip helps to reduce fatigue and pain. Tools that can be used in either hand allow workers to alternate hands and the tool can be used properly by the 10 percent of workers who are left-handed. \r\nHandle Size – a well-balanced tool with a properly designed grip or handle instantly feels comfortable in the hand. The right-sized handle is one that allows the hand to go more than halfway around the handle without the thumb and fingers meeting. Grip surfaces – the grip surfaces of hand tools should be smooth, non-conductive, and slightly compressible to dampen vibration and better distribute hand pressure. Avoid tools that have grooves for finger — for most people the grooves are either too big or too widely or closely spaced. The resulting pressure ridges across the hand can damage nerves or create hot spots of pain. \r\nWeight – weight is often a problem with power tools and tools such as drills, hammers, and saws. To reduce hand, arm, and shoulder fatigue, the hand tool should not weigh more than 2.3 kg. If the center of gravity of a heavy tool is far from the wrist, this maximum weight should be reduced. \r\nTriggers – Many power tools have a trigger that is operated either by the thumb or one or more fingers. To avoid hand and forearm fatigue, look for tools that can be activated by either hand. Also, the trigger should have a mechanism that holds or locks it in place while the tool is being used. \r\n",

If you are reading the ohms on a resistor in a printed circuit board, you will have to unsolder or unpin the resistor to assure you are not getting a false reading through another path in the circuit.\r\nStep 6 – Read the resistance of a run of wire or a branch of a circuit to see if there is a short or open break in the circuit. If you read infinite ohms, there is no path for the electrical current to follow, and in simple terms, this suggests a burned out component somewhere in the circuit, or a broken conductor. Because many circuits contain gate devices (transistors or semiconductors), diodes, and capacitors, however, you may not read continuity even when the complete circuit is intact, which makes it difficult to test complete circuits with only an ohmmeter.\r\n",

A complete set of dimensions will permit only one interpretation needed to construct the part. The dimension line is a thin line, broken in the middle to allow the placement of the dimension value, with arrowheads at each end (see diagram below).\r\nOnce the desired views of an object or assembly are created, they are not useful until they are completely and properly dimensioned. Dimensions show size and location of features, as well as specific details that will specify how certain features are manufactured. A properly dimensioned drawing adheres to ANSI Y14.5. These standards were created to generate dimensions that are universally accepted, clear, and easy to interpret.\r\n",

This means that someone reading the drawing and creating the object does not have enough information to reproduce it. A drawing can also contain too many dimensions and in that case would be over specified. Too many dimensions can be equally disruptive to the manufacturing process.\r\n",

The advanced command line operating system is faster then the advanced   GUI operating system.\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface Operating System (GUI)\r\nThe graphical mode interface operating system is a mouse-based operating system (Windows Operating System, LINUX), wherein a user performs the tasks or operations without typing the commands from the keyboard.

    "body": "Memory Management\nMemory management is the process of managing a computer memory. Computer memories are of two types: primary and secondary memory. The memory portion for programs and softwares is allocated after releasing the memory space.\r\nMemory management is important for the operating system involved in multitasking wherein the OS requires switching of memory space from one process to another. Every single program requires some memory space for its execution, which is provided by the memory management unit. A CPU consists of two types of memory modules: virtual memory and physical memory. The virtual memory is a RAM memory, and the physical memory is a hard disk memory. An operating system manages the virtual memory address spaces, and the assignment of real memory is followed by the virtual memory address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask or Process Management\r\nProcess management is an instance of a program that is being executed. The process consists of a number of elements, such as identifier, program counter, memory pointer and context data, and so on. The Process is actually an execution of those instructions.\r\nThere are two types of process methods: single process and multitasking method. The single process method deals with the single application running at a time. The multitasking method allows multiple processes at a time.\r\n\r\nStorage Management\r\nStorage management is a function of the operating system that handles memory allocation of the data. The system consists of different types of memory devices, such as primary storage memory (RAM), secondary storage memory, (Hard disk) and cache storage memory.\r\nInstructions and data are placed in the primary storage or cache memory, which is referenced by the running program. However, the data is lost when power supply cut off. The secondary memory is a permanent storage device. The operating system allocates a storage place when new files are created and the request for memory access is scheduled.\r\n\r\nDevice or Input/output Management\r\nIn a computer architecture, the combination of CPU and main memory is the brain of the computer, and it is managed by the input and output resources. Humans interact with the machines by providing information through I/O devices.\r\n\r\nThe display, keyboard, printer and mouse are I/O devices. The management of all these devices affects the throughput of a system; therefore, the input and output management of the system is a primary responsibility of the operating system\r\n\r\nScheduling\r\nScheduling by an operating system is a process of controlling and prioritizing the messages sent to a processor. The operating system maintains a constant amount of work for the processor and thus balances the work load. As a result, each process is completed within a stipulated time frame.\r\nHence, scheduling is very important in real-time systems. The schedulers are mainly of three types:\r\n Long term scheduler\r\n Short term scheduler\r\n Medium term schedule\r\nReal-time Operating System\r\nReal-time operating systems are also known as multitasking operating systems. The normal operating system is responsible for managing the hardware resources of a computer. The RTOS perform these tasks, but it is especially designed to run applications at a scheduled or precise time with high reliability.\r\nReal-time operating system is designed for real-time applications, such as embedded systems, industrial robots, scientific research equipments and others. There are different types of operating systems in real time, such as soft real-time operating systems and hard real-time operating systems.\r\n Examples of RTOS\r\n RTLinux\r\n Windows CE\r\nHard Real-time System\r\nThe hard real time system is a purely time constant system. For a hard real time operating system, finishing the tasks within deadline is very important for an efficient system performance.\r\nFor example, for a given input, if a user expects the output after 10seconds, then the system should process the input data and give the output exactly after 10seconds. Here, the deadline is 10 seconds, and therefore, the system should not give the output after 11th sec or 9th sec.\r\nTherefore, the hard real-time systems are used in army and defense.\r\nSoft Real-time System\r\nFor a soft real-time system, meeting the deadline is not mandatory for every task. Therefore, a soft real-time system can miss the deadline by one or two seconds. However, if the system misses deadlines every time, this will degrade the system performance. Computers, audio and video systems are examples of soft real-time systems. Nowadays, Androids are being widely used for applications like automatic gate openers.\r\n\r\n",

Dynamic RAM is more complicated for interfacing and control, needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its bodys, but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per-bit costs.\r\nSRAM is not worthwhile for desktop system memory, where DRAM dominates, but is used for their cache memories. SRAM is commonplace in small embedded systems, which might only need tens of kilobytes or less. Forthcoming volatile memory technologies that aim at replacing or competing with SRAM and DRAM include Z-RAM and A-RAM.\r\n",

Some products also include protection from other computer threats, such as infected and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), online banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT) and botnet DDoS attacks. \r\n",

Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behaviour of a file (as either malicious or benign) given a series of file features, that are extracted from the file itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignature-based detection\r\nTraditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware.\r\nSubstantially, when a malware arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm, it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.\r\n\r\nAlthough the signature-based approach can effectively contain malware outbreaks, malware authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing \"oligomorphic\", \"polymorphic\" and, more recently, \"metamorphic\" viruses, which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise, so as to not match virus signatures in the dictionary.\r\n",

Generic detection refers to the detection and removal of multiple threats using a single virus definition.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Vundo trojan has several family members, depending on the antivirus vendor's classification. Symantec classifies members of the Vundo family into two distinct categories, Trojan.Vundo and Trojan.Vundo.B.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be advantageous to identify a specific virus, it can be quicker to detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain non-contiguous code, using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. A detection that uses this method is said to be \"heuristic detection.\"\r\n",

Its essential component is usually a strip of metal that will melt at a given temperature. A fuse is so designed that the strip of metal can easily be placed in the electric circuit. If the current in the circuit exceed a predetermined value, the fusible metal will melt and thus break, or open the circuit.\r\n• A fuse is usually rated in Amperes, which represent the maximum continuous current it could handle without blowing.\r\n• The most popular type of fuse in Electronics is 3AG type. This code describes the case size and material where “G” indicates a glass materials and “A” indicates that intended for automotive application. A 3AG fuse measures approximately 32mm x 6mm.\r\n",

Although the term “wire” properly refers to the metal, it also includes the insulation.\n\r\n• A conductor is a wire suitable for carrying an electric current. \r\n\r\n• A stranded conductor is a conductor composed of a group of wire or any combination of group of wires. The wires in a stranded conductor are usually twisted together and not insulated from each other.  \r\n\r\n• A cable is either a stranded conductor (single‐conductor cable) or a combination of conductors insulated from one another (multiple‐conductor cable). The term “cable” is a general one and usually applies only to the large sizes of conductor. A small cable is more often called a stranded wire or cord (such as that used for an iron or a lamp cord).

This solder is known as leaded solder. As it has come to be known, lead is harmful to humans and can lead to lead poisoning when exposed to large amounts. Unfortunately, lead is also a very useful metal, and it was chosen as the go-to metal for soldering because of its low melting point and ability to create great solder joints.\nWith the adverse effects of leaded soldering known, some key individuals and countries decided it was best to not use leaded solder anymore. In 2006, the European Union adopted the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive(RoHS). This directive, stated simply, restricts the use of leaded solder (amongst other materials) in electronics and electrical equipment. With that, the use of lead-free solder became the norm in electronics manufacturing.\n",

However, when it comes to you and your electronics, the choice of solder is yours to make. Many people still prefer the use of leaded solder on account of its superb ability to act as a joining agent. Still, others prefer safety over functionality and opt for the lead-free. SparkFun sells both varieties to allow individuals to make that choice for themselves.\nLead-free solder is not without its downfalls. As mentioned, lead was chosen because it performs the best in a situation such as soldering. When you take away the lead, you also take away some of the properties of solder that make it ideal for what it was intended – joining two pieces of metal. One such property is the melting point. Tin has a higher melting point than lead resulting in more heat needed to achieve flow. And, although tin gets the job done, it sometimes needs a little help. Many lead-free solder variants have what’s called a flux core. For now, just know that flux is a chemical agent that aids in the flowing of lead-free solder. While it is possible to use lead-free solder without flux, it makes it much easier to achieve the same effects as with leaded solder. Also, because of the added cost in making lead-free solder, it can sometimes be more expensive than leaded solder.\n",

Second, solder comes in a variety of gauges, or widths. When working with small components, it’s often better to use a very thin piece of solder – the larger then number, the smaller the gauge. For large components, thicker wire is recommended. Last, solder comes in other forms besides wire. When getting into surface-mount soldering, you’ll see that solder paste is the form of choice.

Spot the hazard\nA hazard is anything that could hurt you or someone else.\nExamples of workplace hazards include:\nfrayed electrical cords (could result in electrical shock)\nboxes stacked precariously (they could fall on someone)\nnoisy machinery (could result in damage to your hearing)\nDuring work experience, you must remain alert to anything that may be dangerous. If you see, hear or smell anything odd, take note. If you think it could be a hazard, tell someone.\n2. Assess the risk\nAssessing the risk means working out how likely it is that a hazard will harm someone and how serious the harm could be.\nWhenever you spot a hazard, assess the risk by asking yourself two questions:\nhow likely is it that the hazard could harm me or someone else?\nhow badly could I or someone else be harmed?\nAlways tell someone (your employer, your supervisor or your health and safety representative) about hazards you can't fix yourself, especially if the hazard could cause serious harm to anyone.\nFor example:\nask your supervisor for instructions and training before using equipment\nask for help moving or lifting heavy objects\ntell your supervisor if you think a work practice could be dangerous\nIf you are not sure of the safest way to do something on work experience, always ask your work experience supervisor.\n3. Make the changes\nIt is your employer's responsibility to fix hazards. Sometimes you may be able to fix simple hazards yourself, as long as you don't put yourself or others at risk. For example, you can pick up things from the floor and put them away to eliminate a trip hazard.\nThe best way to fix a hazard is to get rid of it altogether. This is not always possible, but your employer should try to make hazards less dangerous by looking at the following options (in order from most effective to least effective):\nElimination - Sometimes hazards - equipment, substances or work practices - can be avoided entirely. (e.g. Clean high windows from the ground with an extendable pole cleaner, rather than by climbing a ladder and risking a fall.)\nSubstitution - Sometimes a less hazardous thing, substance or work practice can be used. (e.g. Use a non-toxic glue instead of a toxic glue.)\nIsolation - Separate the hazard from people, by marking the hazardous area, fitting screens or putting up safety barriers. (e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\nSafeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\nInstructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\nUsing personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.",

Using the right equipment is one of the most important parts of the procedure, as failure to do so can result in a circuit remaining live, resulting in injury or death.\nWhat equipment is required for safe isolation?\nThe Electrical Safety First Guidance states that \"…The point of isolation should be locked off using a unique key or combination retained by the person carrying out the work or the appointed person, and a caution notice attached to the point of isolation.\nWhere more than one operative is working on circuits supplied from an isolated distribution board, a multi-lock hasp can be used to prevent operation…\"\nLocking off kits are available to ensure you have all the necessary equipment to lock out the circuit being worked on\nhere are a number of kits available on the market, however a basic kit should include the following:",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

    "body": "A code of practice applies to anyone who has a duty of care in the circumstances described in the code. The codes of practice provide guidance for electrical safety duties and standards required under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB). They also outline effective ways to identify and manage electrical safety risks.\nThe codes of practice deal with particular issues and do not cover every hazard or risk. You are required to consider all electrical safety risks, not just those outlined in the regulations and codes of practice. You should read the electrical safety codes of practice along with other codes of practice such as How to manage work health and safety risks - Code of practice 2011 (PDF, 594KB).\nFollowing the codes of practice generally means that you have achieved compliance in your workplace.\nCodes of practice can be used in court proceedings as the courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk or control. The courts may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\nThe Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB), supported by the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) and the 4 codes of practice contain information on how to identify and manage electrical safety risks. They can help you to make your workplace safer.\nThe Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) helps you to identify specific ways to meet your electrical safety duties under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB) and establishes requirements for:\nelectrical work\nelectrical licensing\nworking near overhead and underground electric lines\nelectrical installations\nin-scope electrical equipment\nworks of an electricity entity\nelectricity supply\nsafety management systems for prescribed electricity entities\ncathodic protection systems\nincident notification and reporting.\nIt is important to realise that the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) does not identify all that you need to do in order to fulfil your duties.",

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

    "body": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below. Usually alternating voltage and current are expressed in effective values rather than in peak-to-peak values.\n\nInstantaneous Value:The instantaneous value of an alternating voltage or current is the value of voltage or current at one particular instant. The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing. It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\n\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation.

Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Truly excellent amplifiers will also have a separate (or at least separately regulated) power supply for the input stage (those circuits that do not actually drive the speaker).

Due to improvements in the speed, power capacity and efficiency of modern semiconductor devices, applications using Class D amps have become affordable for the common person. Class D amplifiers use a completely different method of amplification as compared to Class A, B and AB.  Whereas the aforementioned classes of amplifier operate the semiconductor devices in the linear mode, Class D amplifiers operate the output semiconductor devices as switches (ON or OFF).  In a Class D amplifier, the input signal is compared with a high frequency triangle wave, resulting in the generation of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) type signal.  This signal (which some people incorrectly identify as a “digital” signal) is then applied to a special filter that removes all the unwanted high frequency by-products of the PWM stage.  The output of the filter drives the speaker.  Please note that this is a VERY high level idea of how Class D amplifiers work! Class D amps are (today) most often found in car audio subwoofer amplifiers. The major advantage of Class D amplifiers is that they have the potential for very good efficiency (due to the fact that the semiconductor devices are ON or OFF in the power stage, resulting in low power dissipation in the device as compared to linear amplifier classes).  One notable disadvantage of Class D amplifiers: they are fairly complicated and special care is required in their design (to make them reliable).  Due to the high frequencies that are present in the audio signal (as a result of the PWM stage), Class D amps used for car stereo applications are often limited to subwoofer frequencies, however designs are improving all the time. It will not be too long before a full band class D amp becomes commonplace and less costly. Class D amps find use in many other applications besides audio.  Class D amplifiers will probably eventually revolutionize audio power amplifiers: when they are perfected, their efficiency will allow outputs of 1000+ watts without the need for a cooling fan!  They will also be small and lightweight compared to the class AB designs that are most common today",

At this time I will not go into the details of all of these other classes. Suffice to note that Class D (among A, B, AB, D, S, G, H classes) is the class that represents a major delta in the way it operates as compared to the other audio amplifier classes.

The marketplace tends to toss around the word \"digital\" a lot, there is no really standardized definition (that I am aware of) that deems an amp \"digital\".

If you have ever looked at a spec sheet for a decent quality amplifier, you probably noticed that the power output of an amplifier is higher when the load impedance (number of ohms) is lower. Important: a load with a low number of ohms is a more difficult load than one with a higher number of ohms! That is, a 4 ohm speaker is harder for an amplifier to drive than an 8 ohm speaker. The performance capabilities of an amplifier when driving low impedance loads is closely related to the capabilities of its power supply.\nIf we had a perfect amplifier (and it was plugged into an outlet that had unlimited current capability), its output power rating would double each time the load impedance was halved. For example, let's say the amplifier puts out 200 watts per channel at 8 ohms. At 4 ohms, it would put out 400 watts per channel, at 2 ohms it would put out 800 watts per channel, and at 1 ohm it would put out 1600 watts per channel. For the perfect amplifier, one could keep going with this until the load impedance approached zero, at which time the amplifier output would approach infinity! On the other side, if the load impedance was 16 ohms, the amplifier would put out only 100 watts per channel. In this direction, one could keep raising the load impedance, and the power output would grow smaller and smaller.\nThe power supply of the perfect amplifier generates a DC voltage that does not change no matter how much current is demanded from it. This means that the perfect amplifier can drive an unlimited number of speakers. In the real world, amplifiers have real power supplies which do have limits as to how much current they deliver (and real world amps use output devices that are only rated for so much current before they self destruct). For such typical amplifiers, the 4 ohm power rating is usually about 50% more than the 8 ohm rating (and if a 2 ohm rating is given, this is maybe double that of the 8 ohm rating). Amplifiers with exceptional power supply designs will do better than this, but eventually a limit will be reached (if by nothing else the AC outlet can only deliver so much current!). Lesser designs will \"run out of juice” when driving the heavier loads. Most decent amplifier spec sheets will specify how much power the amp can deliver into various load impedances.  If an amp’s spec sheet gives a 8 and 4 ohm rating, be careful before using the amp with 2 ohm loads.  It might work, but more likely it will be stressed out and may overheat or fail prematurely.  \nAmplifiers utilizing exceptional power supply designs will invariably be the more expensive units available, and possibly the (physically) heavier designs. This is because good power supply designs usually require heavier and better (low loss) \"magnetics\". All power supplies utilize some combination of transformers, rectifiers, capacitors, and in the case of some so called \"digital\" amplifiers, switching components.",

    "body": "Many of the better amplifiers on the market today are touting excellent performance with 2 ohm load impedances. Some also state that \"continuous operation\" with 2 ohm loads is possible. While such statements are probably true, it may not be a good idea to operate the amplifier under such conditions!\nEven though an amplifier may be rated for continuous use at 2ohms, there are several reasons why this may not be the best thing to do:\nParalleled speaker loads may be lower than you think: No speakers that DJ's are likely to use have 2ohm ratings. However, a pair of 4 ohm speakers paralleled will yield a nominal 2 ohm rating. As stated before, the actual impedance varies and the minimum impedance may dip considerably below 2 ohms at certain frequencies. Lower impedance loads mean more losses and more heat dissipation in the amplifier (see next item). \nHeat Considerations: Operating an amplifier with a low impedance load (especially a low impedance reactive load) increases the heat dissipation of the amplifier (try it if you don't believe it!). This is because low impedance loads require more current, which taxes the amplifier’s power supply more severely. More current means more losses (which translates to more heat both in the power supply and output stage devices). Excessive heat is unhealthy for electronic devices and should be avoided. \nIncreased Line Losses: As the speaker impedance is lowered, more of the audio signal is lost (in the form of heat) in the speaker cables! This can become significant if you run long cables. Speaker wires have resistance (the value depends on the thickness and length of the cable); if the speaker impedance becomes very low the resistance of the speaker wire may no longer be insignificant. To prevent this problem, the cross sectional area of the speaker cable conductor must double for each halving of speaker load impedance! In other words, running 2 ohm loads means using VERY heavy speaker cables (especially so if they are of significant length) in order to avoid losing costly audio power in the speaker cables. \nDamping Factor degradation: Using super low impedance loads on an amplifier will degrade the system's damping factor (discussed in detail below). Degradation of damping factor means that the amplifier will have less \"control\" over the speaker system, possibly resulting in a degradation of the sound quality.",

Very simply, clipping of an amplifier occurs when one tries to get a larger output signal out of an amplifier than it was designed to provide.\nAs stated before, all power amplifiers have a DC power supply which provides power to (among other things) the output stage of the amplifier. For most amplifiers, the power supply consists of a \"plus\" supply and a \"minus\" supply. The two voltages are often referred to as \"rail voltages\" or simply \"rails\". As an example, a 200 wpc amplifier (at 8 ohms) might have a power supply voltage (rails) of +/- 60 volts DC. This means that the output voltage which drives the speaker can never exceed + 60 or - 60 volts. If the amplifier is playing at near full volume, and someone “cranks up the volume”, the amplifier will attempt to put out more power. However, the power required to meet the sudden new demand for more volume cannot be met by the power supply voltage, which has limits of +/-60 volts in this example. The result is a waveform with the top portion (or peak) \"clipped\" off (hence the term \"clipping\"). Such clipping represents a distortion which is added to the waveform (and if it is severe enough it will be clearly audible). If a signal is severely clipped, the waveform takes on the shape of a \"square wave\", and the resulting sound will be absolutely hideous. Clipping can be easily observed using an oscilloscope attached to the amplifier output.",

It is no longer a two channel (stereo) amp as far as input signals and loads are concerned. If you have two speakers and want to use bridged amplifiers in a stereo mode, you will need two stereo amplifiers (one stereo amplifier for each input channel). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode accept a single input signal. Normally, the input will be \"Channel 1\" or \"left\". Manufacturers vary however, so check the instruction manual for the proper input wiring procedures. \nIf the amp you want to run in bridged mode does not have built in facilities for doing so, you should not attempt to use it in this manner (unless you are thoroughly sure of what you are doing). A blown amp could result if you make a mistake or bad assumption.\nIf you run bridged amplifiers, you must pay close attention to speaker wiring phasing, otherwise, you may have \"hollow\" or \"weak\" sound. The speaker cable connection in bridged mode connects to the two positive (usually red) speaker connection terminals on the amplifier (the ground (black) connections are not used). The manufacturer will state which red terminal is really the \"positive\" connection.  The speaker won’t care about phasing, but you (normally) want all your speakers phased the same (otherwise they will tend to cancel each other out and result in less sound).\nThe speaker output signals of a bridged amplifier are floating; such connections must never be connected to any grounded device (such as an external accessory power meter, for example). If you do make such an illegal connection, one amplifier channel is basically short circuited (worst case result is a blown amplifier!). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode are usually capable of doing so only with speakers that have impedance of twice the minimum impedance the amp is rated for when in normal mode. In other words, if an amp is rated to handle 4 ohm loads in normal mode, in general the minimum load for bridged mode will be 8 ohms. Check your amp's specifications for details. ",

    "body": "Bi-amplification is (in most cases) defined as using more than one amplifier to power a speaker system (typically one amp for bass and one for mid/high frequencies). The key point here is that each amplifier is dedicated to a specific frequency band (whereas with single amplifier systems the one amp covers the entire audio range).  Similarly, some systems are tri-amplified and once in a while you may see a 4 or 5 way system (although the latter is usually reserved for only the most powerful touring type sound systems). Bi-amplification has many significant benefits:\nLower Distortion By using a separate amp for bass and a separate amp for mid/highs, the bass amp can clip without adversely impacting the overall sound quality. Chances are that the ugly sounding distortion produced by clipping an amp will not sound as bad coming out of a woofer (because woofers don't reproduce the high frequency distortion signals very well). Note that this means you should not consider clipping a good thing, it's just that the impact won't be as bad. \nMore total output Let's say you have a 400 watt single amp and 300 watt bass amp and 100 watt high/mid amp for use in a bi-amped configuration. You will be (in most cases) be able to get a higher volume out of the bi-amped system as compared to the single 400 watt system. Why is this? Isn't the total power the same for both setups? It is. However, due to the nature of musical waveforms, you'll be better able to handle large peak signals better. For example a loud bass sound and a loud HF sound at the same time may require a signal level that would clip the 400 watt amp. However, because in the bi-amp system the signal is split into different frequency bands, there's a better chance of handling the signal without clipping. Note that you can't expect to get a large amount of increase in sound level by using bi-amped systems, but in general you will get somewhat more capacity and at the same time significantly reduced levels of distortion. \nBetter Crossover performance The bad news is that bi-amplification requires that the signals to the amps be split into low and high bands BEFORE they are input to the amp. This requires what is called an \"electronic\" or \"active\" crossover network. The bad news is that this means more money, more wiring and more chances for problems if you don’t hook it up correctly.  However, the advantages of a bi or tri amped system make it the only choice for high power high performance systems.  Using an electronic crossover eliminates the need for large, expensive, lossy and non linear passive low frequency crossovers in bass systems. Elimination of passive crossovers (in the speaker cabinets) can significantly increase the quality of the sound!  Also, it is easy to design steep slope crossovers using active electronics, allowing for very sharp cutoff of lows and highs (a good thing for HF systems). Also, most active crossovers allow one to adjust the crossover frequency, adjust the level of the signal and vary the phase. For high power systems, bi-amplification is the norm (and tri-amplification is not at all uncommon). ",

In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger sized grains.

    "body": "To compute the Luminance signal (which is known as \"Y\"), circuitry at the television station or transmitter takes Red, Green and Blue signals from the television camera or other equipment and generates Y using this formula: \nY Luminance = (Red x 0.30) + (Green x 0.59) + (Blue x 0.11) \nThis weighting is also built into the circuitry of the video graphics circuitry in computer video systems so that it should be impossible to have the total of signal strength emitted by a video card exceed 100%. This means that when a color is specified in computer software or in HTML, an increment of one for the setting for Green brightness causes a much larger increase in overall brightness on the display than an increment of one in the Red or Blue colors. \n(Note: Some televisions and computer monitors allow you to deviate from these values slightly by changing the \"Color Temperature\". Web page designers should avoid designing colors based on any custom temperature settings that they may have set on their own monitor.) \nThe other two signals that are transmitted by a television station that are used to represent Chrominance (color) are generated using these formulas: \nQ Signal = (Red x 0.21) - (Green x 0.52) + (Blue x 0.31) \nI Signal = (Red x 0.60) - (Green x 0.28) - (Blue x 0.32) \nHere is a set of standard NTSC \"color bars\", followed by \"luminance bars\". If both sets of bars were displayed on a black and white display, the shades of gray in each vertical column would be identical. In other words, the area that appears as Green, when shown on a black and white monitor, would appear as the same shade of gray as that which appears directly below the Green color. This is because each shade of Gray that is shown has the same level of Luminance as the color directly above. The luminance bars merely lack the Chrominance component. \nThe numerical values that create each color or luminance shade in NTSC television are shown, as well as what the the equivalent computer display settings are.

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "body": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "body": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

The antenna intercepts radio waves (electromagnetic waves) and converts them to tiny alternating currents which are applied to the receiver, and the receiver extracts the desired information. The receiver uses electronic filters to separate the desired radio frequency signal from all the other signals picked up by the antenna, an electronic amplifier to increase the power of the signal for further processing, and finally recovers the desired information through demodulation.\nThe information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound, images, or data.[1] A radio receiver may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. Radio receivers are components of communications, broadcasting, remote control, and network systems.

Spot the hazard\nA hazard is anything that could hurt you or someone else.\nExamples of workplace hazards include:\nfrayed electrical cords (could result in electrical shock)\nboxes stacked precariously (they could fall on someone)\nnoisy machinery (could result in damage to your hearing)\nDuring work experience, you must remain alert to anything that may be dangerous. If you see, hear or smell anything odd, take note. If you think it could be a hazard, tell someone.\n2. Assess the risk\nAssessing the risk means working out how likely it is that a hazard will harm someone and how serious the harm could be.\nWhenever you spot a hazard, assess the risk by asking yourself two questions:\nhow likely is it that the hazard could harm me or someone else?\nhow badly could I or someone else be harmed?\nAlways tell someone (your employer, your supervisor or your health and safety representative) about hazards you can't fix yourself, especially if the hazard could cause serious harm to anyone.\nFor example:\nask your supervisor for instructions and training before using equipment\nask for help moving or lifting heavy objects\ntell your supervisor if you think a work practice could be dangerous\nIf you are not sure of the safest way to do something on work experience, always ask your work experience supervisor.\n3. Make the changes\nIt is your employer's responsibility to fix hazards. Sometimes you may be able to fix simple hazards yourself, as long as you don't put yourself or others at risk. For example, you can pick up things from the floor and put them away to eliminate a trip hazard.\nThe best way to fix a hazard is to get rid of it altogether. This is not always possible, but your employer should try to make hazards less dangerous by looking at the following options (in order from most effective to least effective):\nElimination - Sometimes hazards - equipment, substances or work practices - can be avoided entirely. (e.g. Clean high windows from the ground with an extendable pole cleaner, rather than by climbing a ladder and risking a fall.)\nSubstitution - Sometimes a less hazardous thing, substance or work practice can be used. (e.g. Use a non-toxic glue instead of a toxic glue.)\nIsolation - Separate the hazard from people, by marking the hazardous area, fitting screens or putting up safety barriers. (e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\nSafeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\nInstructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\nUsing personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

The codes of practice provide guidance for electrical safety duties and standards required under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB). They also outline effective ways to identify and manage electrical safety risks.\nThe codes of practice deal with particular issues and do not cover every hazard or risk. You are required to consider all electrical safety risks, not just those outlined in the regulations and codes of practice. You should read the electrical safety codes of practice along with other codes of practice such as How to manage work health and safety risks - Code of practice 2011 (PDF, 594KB).\nFollowing the codes of practice generally means that you have achieved compliance in your workplace.\nCodes of practice can be used in court proceedings as the courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk or control. The courts may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\nThe Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB), supported by the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) and the 4 codes of practice contain information on how to identify and manage electrical safety risks. They can help you to make your workplace safer.\nThe Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) (PDF, 1.1MB) helps you to identify specific ways to meet your electrical safety duties under the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) (PDF, 1MB) and establishes requirements for:\nelectrical work\nelectrical licensing\nworking near overhead and underground electric lines\nelectrical installations\nin-scope electrical equipment\nworks of an electricity entity\nelectricity supply\nsafety management systems for prescribed electricity entities\ncathodic protection systems\nincident notification and reporting.\nIt is important to realise that the Electrical Safety Regulation 2013 (Qld) does not identify all that you need to do in order to fulfil your duties.",

And I know that the voltage out from a voltage divider is a result of the values of those resistors. \nI also know that the resistance of an LDR varies with the amount of light it receives. This means that the voltage out, i.e. the voltage on the base of the transistor, will vary with the amount of light detected by the LDR.\nThen I look at the transistor.

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

    "body": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below. Usually alternating voltage and current are expressed in effective values rather than in peak-to-peak values.\n\nInstantaneous Value:The instantaneous value of an alternating voltage or current is the value of voltage or current at one particular instant. The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing. It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\n\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation.

Troubleshooting often involves a logical process of elimination where a technician will follow a set of steps to identify or to determine the true source of a problem. \n\n1)     Determine what the problem really is. \na.        Ask questions to the owner/operator of the electronically-controlled domestic appliances to identify the problem for you. \nb.        Ask for a description of the problem and how long it has been going on. \nc.         Ask for a comparison of how long such domestic appliance is operating at the present time. \nd.        Inquire whether the domestic appliance has done this in the past and how it is supposed to operate. \n2)    Be sure you understand how the domestic appliance is supposed to operate.\na.         If you have worked on it before, check it out to see if it still operates in the same manner. \nb.        Try to determine if anyone has modified it since you were last involved with it. \nc.         Review the operating manual if you are not overly familiar with the model of the domestic appliance. \nd.        Review the service literature for the unit prior to any testing regardless of your previous knowledge about the domestic appliance. \n3)    Perform preliminary inspection to locate where the problem originated. \na.        If possible, attempt to operate the domestic appliance to gather information about the problem whether or not the system of the unit is functioning. \nb.        While operating the domestic appliance, listen for unusual noises and look for smoke or other visual signs of trouble. \nc.         Do not forget to use your sense of smell to assist in the diagnosis process. \n4)    Perform closer inspection into the suspected parts or components. \na.        Prepare the tools needed and remove the cover ready for inspection. \nb.        Apply careful physical inspection of the suspected parts/components. \nc.         Look for burned and broken components. \nd.        Inspect for loose connections or broken wires. \n5)    Plan your approach to the repair problem. \na.        List the tools and measuring instrument, where to use them and what you expect to find when you conduct the test. \nb.        Modify your plans as you obtain additional information during the testing process.

    "body": "1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials, such as cotton, require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Many materials developed in the twentieth century are advertised as needing little or no ironing.",

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "body": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "body": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

One of these is coulombs per second, a measure of the flow of electrons through a metal conductor or wire. A current of one coulomb per second equals one ampere.\nEven materials that conduct electricity resist the flow of electrons. The unit of electrical resistance is an ohm. The pressure needed to make one coulomb per second (one ampere) flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm is one volt.\nOhm's Law explains the relationships between voltage (E), resistance (R), and current (I).\nIn two circuits of equal voltage, the current will be proportionately greater in the circuit of lower resistance. In circuits of equal resistance, the current flowing will be directly proportional to the voltage applied. Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

    "body": "Alternating current is the current which constantly changes in amplitude, and which reverses direction at regular intervals. We know that direct current flows only in one direction, and that the amplitude of current is determined by the number of electrons flowing past a point in circuit in one second. If,for example, a coulomb of electrons moves past a point in a wire in one second and all of the electrons are moving in the same direction,the amplitude of direct current in the wire is one ampere. Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.\n\nFrequency:\nOne of the most important properties of any regular waveform identifies the number\nof complete cycles it goes through in a fixed period of time. For standard measurements, the period of time is one second, so the frequency of the wave is commonly measured in cycles per second (cycles/sec) and, in normal usage, is expressed in units of Hertz (Hz). It is represented in mathematical equationsby the letter ‘f’.\n\nPeriod: Sometimes we need to know the amount of time required to complete one cycle of the\nwaveform, rather than the number of cycles per second of time. This is logically the reciprocal of frequency. Thus, period is the time duration of one cycle of the waveform, and is measured in seconds/cycle.\n\nWavelength:Because an A.C. wave moves physically as well as changing in time, sometimes we need to know how far it moves in one cycle of thewave, rather than how long that cycle takes to complete. This of course depends on how fast thewave is moving as well. The Greek letter (lambda) is used to represent wavelength in mathematical expressions. And, 位= c/f. As shown in the figure to the above, wavelength can be measured from any part of one cycle to the equivalent point in the next cycle. Wavelength is very similar to period as discussed above, except that wavelength is measured in distance per cycle while period is measured in time per cycle.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below. Usually alternating voltage and current are expressed in effective values rather than in peak-to-peak values.\n\nInstantaneous Value:The instantaneous value of an alternating voltage or current is the value of voltage or current at one particular instant. The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing. It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\n\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation.

Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Truly excellent amplifiers will also have a separate (or at least separately regulated) power supply for the input stage (those circuits that do not actually drive the speaker).

Balanced inputs are much preferred over single ended inputs when interconnection cables are long and/or subject to noisy electrical environments because they provide very good noise rejection.

Due to improvements in the speed, power capacity and efficiency of modern semiconductor devices, applications using Class D amps have become affordable for the common person. Class D amplifiers use a completely different method of amplification as compared to Class A, B and AB.  Whereas the aforementioned classes of amplifier operate the semiconductor devices in the linear mode, Class D amplifiers operate the output semiconductor devices as switches (ON or OFF).  In a Class D amplifier, the input signal is compared with a high frequency triangle wave, resulting in the generation of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) type signal.  This signal (which some people incorrectly identify as a “digital” signal) is then applied to a special filter that removes all the unwanted high frequency by-products of the PWM stage.  The output of the filter drives the speaker.  Please note that this is a VERY high level idea of how Class D amplifiers work! Class D amps are (today) most often found in car audio subwoofer amplifiers. The major advantage of Class D amplifiers is that they have the potential for very good efficiency (due to the fact that the semiconductor devices are ON or OFF in the power stage, resulting in low power dissipation in the device as compared to linear amplifier classes).  One notable disadvantage of Class D amplifiers: they are fairly complicated and special care is required in their design (to make them reliable).  Due to the high frequencies that are present in the audio signal (as a result of the PWM stage), Class D amps used for car stereo applications are often limited to subwoofer frequencies, however designs are improving all the time. It will not be too long before a full band class D amp becomes commonplace and less costly. Class D amps find use in many other applications besides audio.  Class D amplifiers will probably eventually revolutionize audio power amplifiers: when they are perfected, their efficiency will allow outputs of 1000+ watts without the need for a cooling fan!  They will also be small and lightweight compared to the class AB designs that are most common today",

At this time I will not go into the details of all of these other classes. Suffice to note that Class D (among A, B, AB, D, S, G, H classes) is the class that represents a major delta in the way it operates as compared to the other audio amplifier classes. Sometimes the consumer marketplace promotes Class D amplifiers as being \"digital\". The marketplace tends to toss around the word \"digital\" a lot, there is no really standardized definition (that I am aware of) that deems an amp \"digital\". To find out what a vendor means when they use the word digital with regard to an amp requires research into the design of the amp.

    "body": "Audio Power amplifiers are typically rated for \"8 ohm\" and \"4 ohm” loads, and more and more (the higher end pro amps) are also giving ratings for continuous operation using \"2 ohm\" loads (loads being speakers, you can see more info on this topic in my article on speakers). If you have ever looked at a spec sheet for a decent quality amplifier, you probably noticed that the power output of an amplifier is higher when the load impedance (number of ohms) is lower. Important: a load with a low number of ohms is a more difficult load than one with a higher number of ohms! That is, a 4 ohm speaker is harder for an amplifier to drive than an 8 ohm speaker. The performance capabilities of an amplifier when driving low impedance loads is closely related to the capabilities of its power supply.\nIf we had a perfect amplifier (and it was plugged into an outlet that had unlimited current capability), its output power rating would double each time the load impedance was halved. For example, let's say the amplifier puts out 200 watts per channel at 8 ohms. At 4 ohms, it would put out 400 watts per channel, at 2 ohms it would put out 800 watts per channel, and at 1 ohm it would put out 1600 watts per channel. For the perfect amplifier, one could keep going with this until the load impedance approached zero, at which time the amplifier output would approach infinity! On the other side, if the load impedance was 16 ohms, the amplifier would put out only 100 watts per channel. In this direction, one could keep raising the load impedance, and the power output would grow smaller and smaller.\nThe power supply of the perfect amplifier generates a DC voltage that does not change no matter how much current is demanded from it. This means that the perfect amplifier can drive an unlimited number of speakers. In the real world, amplifiers have real power supplies which do have limits as to how much current they deliver (and real world amps use output devices that are only rated for so much current before they self destruct). For such typical amplifiers, the 4 ohm power rating is usually about 50% more than the 8 ohm rating (and if a 2 ohm rating is given, this is maybe double that of the 8 ohm rating). Amplifiers with exceptional power supply designs will do better than this, but eventually a limit will be reached (if by nothing else the AC outlet can only deliver so much current!). Lesser designs will \"run out of juice” when driving the heavier loads. Most decent amplifier spec sheets will specify how much power the amp can deliver into various load impedances.  If an amp’s spec sheet gives a 8 and 4 ohm rating, be careful before using the amp with 2 ohm loads.  It might work, but more likely it will be stressed out and may overheat or fail prematurely.  \nAmplifiers utilizing exceptional power supply designs will invariably be the more expensive units available, and possibly the (physically) heavier designs. This is because good power supply designs usually require heavier and better (low loss) \"magnetics\". All power supplies utilize some combination of transformers, rectifiers, capacitors, and in the case of some so called \"digital\" amplifiers, switching components.",

    "body": "Many of the better amplifiers on the market today are touting excellent performance with 2 ohm load impedances. Some also state that \"continuous operation\" with 2 ohm loads is possible. While such statements are probably true, it may not be a good idea to operate the amplifier under such conditions!\nEven though an amplifier may be rated for continuous use at 2ohms, there are several reasons why this may not be the best thing to do:\nParalleled speaker loads may be lower than you think: No speakers that DJ's are likely to use have 2ohm ratings. However, a pair of 4 ohm speakers paralleled will yield a nominal 2 ohm rating. As stated before, the actual impedance varies and the minimum impedance may dip considerably below 2 ohms at certain frequencies. Lower impedance loads mean more losses and more heat dissipation in the amplifier (see next item). \nHeat Considerations: Operating an amplifier with a low impedance load (especially a low impedance reactive load) increases the heat dissipation of the amplifier (try it if you don't believe it!). This is because low impedance loads require more current, which taxes the amplifier’s power supply more severely. More current means more losses (which translates to more heat both in the power supply and output stage devices). Excessive heat is unhealthy for electronic devices and should be avoided. \nIncreased Line Losses: As the speaker impedance is lowered, more of the audio signal is lost (in the form of heat) in the speaker cables! This can become significant if you run long cables. Speaker wires have resistance (the value depends on the thickness and length of the cable); if the speaker impedance becomes very low the resistance of the speaker wire may no longer be insignificant. To prevent this problem, the cross sectional area of the speaker cable conductor must double for each halving of speaker load impedance! In other words, running 2 ohm loads means using VERY heavy speaker cables (especially so if they are of significant length) in order to avoid losing costly audio power in the speaker cables. \nDamping Factor degradation: Using super low impedance loads on an amplifier will degrade the system's damping factor (discussed in detail below). Degradation of damping factor means that the amplifier will have less \"control\" over the speaker system, possibly resulting in a degradation of the sound quality.",

Very simply, clipping of an amplifier occurs when one tries to get a larger output signal out of an amplifier than it was designed to provide.\nAs stated before, all power amplifiers have a DC power supply which provides power to (among other things) the output stage of the amplifier. For most amplifiers, the power supply consists of a \"plus\" supply and a \"minus\" supply. The two voltages are often referred to as \"rail voltages\" or simply \"rails\". As an example, a 200 wpc amplifier (at 8 ohms) might have a power supply voltage (rails) of +/- 60 volts DC. This means that the output voltage which drives the speaker can never exceed + 60 or - 60 volts. If the amplifier is playing at near full volume, and someone “cranks up the volume”, the amplifier will attempt to put out more power. However, the power required to meet the sudden new demand for more volume cannot be met by the power supply voltage, which has limits of +/-60 volts in this example. The result is a waveform with the top portion (or peak) \"clipped\" off (hence the term \"clipping\"). Such clipping represents a distortion which is added to the waveform (and if it is severe enough it will be clearly audible). If a signal is severely clipped, the waveform takes on the shape of a \"square wave\", and the resulting sound will be absolutely hideous. Clipping can be easily observed using an oscilloscope attached to the amplifier output.",

It is no longer a two channel (stereo) amp as far as input signals and loads are concerned. If you have two speakers and want to use bridged amplifiers in a stereo mode, you will need two stereo amplifiers (one stereo amplifier for each input channel). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode accept a single input signal. Normally, the input will be \"Channel 1\" or \"left\". Manufacturers vary however, so check the instruction manual for the proper input wiring procedures. \nIf the amp you want to run in bridged mode does not have built in facilities for doing so, you should not attempt to use it in this manner (unless you are thoroughly sure of what you are doing). A blown amp could result if you make a mistake or bad assumption.\nIf you run bridged amplifiers, you must pay close attention to speaker wiring phasing, otherwise, you may have \"hollow\" or \"weak\" sound. The speaker cable connection in bridged mode connects to the two positive (usually red) speaker connection terminals on the amplifier (the ground (black) connections are not used). The manufacturer will state which red terminal is really the \"positive\" connection.  The speaker won’t care about phasing, but you (normally) want all your speakers phased the same (otherwise they will tend to cancel each other out and result in less sound).\nThe speaker output signals of a bridged amplifier are floating; such connections must never be connected to any grounded device (such as an external accessory power meter, for example). If you do make such an illegal connection, one amplifier channel is basically short circuited (worst case result is a blown amplifier!). \nAmplifiers running in bridged mode are usually capable of doing so only with speakers that have impedance of twice the minimum impedance the amp is rated for when in normal mode. In other words, if an amp is rated to handle 4 ohm loads in normal mode, in general the minimum load for bridged mode will be 8 ohms. Check your amp's specifications for details. ",

    "body": "Bi-amplification is (in most cases) defined as using more than one amplifier to power a speaker system (typically one amp for bass and one for mid/high frequencies). The key point here is that each amplifier is dedicated to a specific frequency band (whereas with single amplifier systems the one amp covers the entire audio range).  Similarly, some systems are tri-amplified and once in a while you may see a 4 or 5 way system (although the latter is usually reserved for only the most powerful touring type sound systems). Bi-amplification has many significant benefits:\nLower Distortion By using a separate amp for bass and a separate amp for mid/highs, the bass amp can clip without adversely impacting the overall sound quality. Chances are that the ugly sounding distortion produced by clipping an amp will not sound as bad coming out of a woofer (because woofers don't reproduce the high frequency distortion signals very well). Note that this means you should not consider clipping a good thing, it's just that the impact won't be as bad. \nMore total output Let's say you have a 400 watt single amp and 300 watt bass amp and 100 watt high/mid amp for use in a bi-amped configuration. You will be (in most cases) be able to get a higher volume out of the bi-amped system as compared to the single 400 watt system. Why is this? Isn't the total power the same for both setups? It is. However, due to the nature of musical waveforms, you'll be better able to handle large peak signals better. For example a loud bass sound and a loud HF sound at the same time may require a signal level that would clip the 400 watt amp. However, because in the bi-amp system the signal is split into different frequency bands, there's a better chance of handling the signal without clipping. Note that you can't expect to get a large amount of increase in sound level by using bi-amped systems, but in general you will get somewhat more capacity and at the same time significantly reduced levels of distortion. \nBetter Crossover performance The bad news is that bi-amplification requires that the signals to the amps be split into low and high bands BEFORE they are input to the amp. This requires what is called an \"electronic\" or \"active\" crossover network. The bad news is that this means more money, more wiring and more chances for problems if you don’t hook it up correctly.  However, the advantages of a bi or tri amped system make it the only choice for high power high performance systems.  Using an electronic crossover eliminates the need for large, expensive, lossy and non linear passive low frequency crossovers in bass systems. Elimination of passive crossovers (in the speaker cabinets) can significantly increase the quality of the sound!  Also, it is easy to design steep slope crossovers using active electronics, allowing for very sharp cutoff of lows and highs (a good thing for HF systems). Also, most active crossovers allow one to adjust the crossover frequency, adjust the level of the signal and vary the phase. For high power systems, bi-amplification is the norm (and tri-amplification is not at all uncommon). ",

These stray electrons influence the voltage of the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise.\nTo compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.\nMany noise reduction algorithms tend to damage more or less signals.

This means that when a color is specified in computer software or in HTML, an increment of one for the setting for Green brightness causes a much larger increase in overall brightness on the display than an increment of one in the Red or Blue colors. \n(Note: Some televisions and computer monitors allow you to deviate from these values slightly by changing the \"Color Temperature\". Web page designers should avoid designing colors based on any custom temperature settings that they may have set on their own monitor.) \nThe other two signals that are transmitted by a television station that are used to represent Chrominance (color) are generated using these formulas: \nQ Signal = (Red x 0.21) - (Green x 0.52) + (Blue x 0.31) \nI Signal = (Red x 0.60) - (Green x 0.28) - (Blue x 0.32) \nHere is a set of standard NTSC \"color bars\", followed by \"luminance bars\". If both sets of bars were displayed on a black and white display, the shades of gray in each vertical column would be identical. In other words, the area that appears as Green, when shown on a black and white monitor, would appear as the same shade of gray as that which appears directly below the Green color. This is because each shade of Gray that is shown has the same level of Luminance as the color directly above. The luminance bars merely lack the Chrominance component. \nThe numerical values that create each color or luminance shade in NTSC television are shown, as well as what the the equivalent computer display settings are.

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\nGet visibly involved.\nBe accessible to employees.\nSet a positive example.\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\n1.\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\n2.\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\n3.\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\n4.\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\nTo set a good example, you must:\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \n\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \n\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \n\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \n\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \n\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \n\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \n\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \n\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \n\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \n\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \n\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \n\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \n\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \n\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \n\n\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \n\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \n\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \n\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \n\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \n\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \n\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \n\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

    "body": "Tinning The Soldering Tip\nBefore use, a new soldering tip, or one that is very dirty, must be tinned. \"Tinning\" is the process of coating a soldering tip with a thin coat of solder. This aids in heat transfer between the tip and the component you are soldering, and also gives the solder a base from which to flow from. \nStep 1: Warm Up The Iron\nWarm up the soldering iron or gun thoroughly. Make sure that it has fully come to temperature because you are about to melt a lot of solder on it. This is especially important if the iron is new because it may have been packed with some kind of coating to prevent corrosion.\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare A Little Space\nWhile the soldering iron is warming up, prepare a little space to work. Moisten a little sponge and place it in the base of your soldering iron stand or in a dish close by. Lay down a piece of cardboard in case you drip solder (you probably will) and make sure you have room to work comfortably.\nStep 3: Thoroughly Coat The Tip In Solder\nThoroughly coat the soldering tip in solder. It is very important to cover the entire tip. You will use a considerable amount of solder during this process and it will drip, so be ready. If you leave any part of the tip uncovered it will tend to collect flux residue and will not conduct heat very well, so run the solder up and down the tip and completely around it to totally cover it in molten solder. \nStep 4: Clean The Soldering Tip\nAfter you are certain that the tip is totally coated in solder, wipe the tip off on the wet sponge to remove all the flux residue. Do this immediately so there is no time for the flux to dry out and solidify. \nStep 5: You're Done!\nYou have just tinned your soldering tip. This must be done anytime you replace the tip or clean it so that the iron maintains good heat transfer. ",

    "body": "Step 1: Solder Pot Salvaging and Other Brute Force Methods\nThis first technique is the most destructive and should only be used when you do not plan on keeping the board. I use this method to salvage a lot of components at once. I have a drawer that I keep scrap PCBs and every once and a while, I'll salvage all the parts from them. I find it very therapeutic and relaxing to remove all the components off of a board.\nStep 2: Manual Solder Sucker\nA good manual solder sucker like this one works pretty well for selectively removing through holes parts from a PCB. Cheaper and smaller units do not work as well. They're marketed as compact but they don't works as well due to the limited stroke length and smaller cylinders.\n\nStep 3: Solder Wick\nSolder Wick is basically just copper braid that soaks up solder when you heat it up. Good solder wick should always have flux in it. To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.\nStep 4: Desoldering Machine\nIf you repair a lot of boards, you absolutely need a machine like this. It is basically a soldering iron with a hole in the center of the tip that is connected to a vacuum pump. Just hold it up to any soldered lead and watch the solder suck right up. I can't recommend them enough.\nStep 5: Hot Air Rework Station\n\nFor desoldering a lot surface mount components at once, a variable temperature hot air rework station is the best tool you can use. If the board is completed filled with surface mount components, you can just squeegee off all the parts when the board is up to temperature. They use have different tips for different types of components.\nStep 6: Desoldering Tweezers\n\nFor selectively removing surface mount components, these heated tweezers are great. Once they get up to temperature you just pluck up the components off the board.\nStep 7: Hot Plate\n\nA heavy duty electronic hot plate like this, can be used to heat boards up to soldering temperatures and if you don't have one, I have even seen some people use a pan on their stove to remove components.\nStep 8: Compressed Air\nFor this method, you should definitely make sure to wear eye protection. You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works. \nStep 9: The Hard Way \nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement.",

The phase or line conductors are looped either in switchboard or box and neutrals are looped either in switchboard or from light or fan. Line or phase should never be looped from light or fan.",
