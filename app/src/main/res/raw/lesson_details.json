The data were gathered through an interview with household members using open-ended questions. Interviews were also conducted with garbage collectors as well as scavengers. Results showed that the households generated an average of 3.2 kg of solid waste per day, or 0.50 kg/capita/day. The types of wastes commonly generated are food/kitchen wastes, papers, PET bottles, metals, and cans, boxes/cartons, glass bottles, cellophane/plastics, and yard/garden wastes. The respondents segregate their wastes into PET bottles, glass bottles, and other waste (mixed wastes). ",

Collection is done twice daily, except Sundays, and household members bring their garbage when the garbage truck arrives. However, there are those who dump their garbage in non – designated pick-up points, usually in a corner of the street. The dumped garbage becomes a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms. Some household respondents said that it is possible that the dumping in certain areas caused the dengue fever suffered by some of their family members. Mothers and household helpers are responsible for household waste management.",

Once the desired views of an object or assembly are created, they are not useful until they are completely and properly dimensioned. Dimensions show size and location of features, as well as specific details that will specify how certain features are manufactured. A properly dimensioned drawing adheres to ANSI Y14.5.

Choosing Dimensions; a drawing that does not have all the required dimensions is said to be under specified. This means that someone reading the drawing and creating the object does not have enough information to reproduce it.

These testers are great for checking to see if something like a single-pole switch is working properly. Beware! be sure to turn the power off to the circuit or device that you'll be testing!\n\r\nContinuity testers are also great for checking wire runs for a complete circuit.You may also find short circuits in wiring with this tester, say two wires have melted together inside the outer jacket of NM sheathed cable. By touching one probe to the white and the other to the black wire, if the light lights and the buzz sounds, the wires are identified as shorted together. Once again, be sure the power is off before doing any testing.\r\n",

Unfortunately, lead is also a very useful metal, and it was chosen as the go-to metal for soldering because of its low melting point and ability to create great solder joints.",

When working with small components, it’s often better to use a very thin piece of solder – the larger then number, the smaller the gauge. \n\r\nFor large components, thicker wire is recommended.

(e.g. Clean high windows from the ground with an extendable pole cleaner, rather than by climbing a ladder and risking a fall.)\n• Substitution - Sometimes a less hazardous thing, substance or work practice can be used. (e.g. Use a non-toxic glue instead of a toxic glue.)\r\n• Isolation - Separate the hazard from people, by marking the hazardous area, fitting screens or putting up safety barriers. (e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\r\n• Safeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\r\n• Instructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\r\n• Using personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\r\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.\r\n",

There are many reports where these procedures have not been followed correctly and sadly this has resulted in needless loss of life.\nOne such report involves a large UK electrical contractor, where a circuit had been labelled as not in use, however the engineer working on the system did not have the necessary equipment to prove the system was dead. As a result he came into contact with a live conductor and was killed. The company in question was found guilty of failing to provide the right equipment and fined $300,000 by the HSE.\r\nThe Electrical Safety Council, now renamed as Electrical Safety First, has produced a guidance document that covers the best practice for safe isolation and part of this guidance covers the test equipment that should be used. Using the right equipment is one of the most important parts of the procedure, as failure to do so can result in a circuit remaining live, resulting in injury or death.",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\r\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

Current is directly proportional to voltage, inversely proportional to resistance.\r\nI (Amperes) = E (Volts)/R (Ohms)\r\nAlso: E = IR or R = E/I\r\nOne of the most common electrical measurements you’ll use is the watt, a unit of electrical power: W (Watts) = E (Volts) x I (Amperes).\r\nThe quantity of electric charge is measured in coulombs.",

Similarly,if half a coulomb of electrons moves in one direction past a point in the wire in half a second, then reverses direction and moves past thesame point in the opposite direction during the next half-second, a total of one coulomb of electrons passes the point in one second.The amplitude of the alternating current is one ampere.",

Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective.

Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Truly excellent amplifiers will also have a separate (or at least separately regulated) power supply for the input stage (those circuits that do not actually drive the speaker).  Under heavy load, the power supply voltage internal to the amp can sag (and this can lead to distortion).

While such statements are probably true, it may not be a good idea to operate the amplifier under such conditions!\nEven though an amplifier may be rated for continuous use at 2ohms, there are several reasons why this may not be the best thing to do:\r\nParalleled speaker loads may be lower than you think: No speakers that DJ's are likely to use have 2ohm ratings. However, a pair of 4 ohm speakers paralleled will yield a nominal 2 ohm rating. As stated before, the actual impedance varies and the minimum impedance may dip considerably below 2 ohms at certain frequencies. Lower impedance loads mean more losses and more heat dissipation in the amplifier (see next item). \r\nHeat Considerations: Operating an amplifier with a low impedance load (especially a low impedance reactive load) increases the heat dissipation of the amplifier (try it if you don't believe it!). This is because low impedance loads require more current, which taxes the amplifier’s power supply more severely. More current means more losses (which translates to more heat both in the power supply and output stage devices). Excessive heat is unhealthy for electronic devices and should be avoided. \r\nIncreased Line Losses: As the speaker impedance is lowered, more of the audio signal is lost (in the form of heat) in the speaker cables! This can become significant if you run long cables. Speaker wires have resistance (the value depends on the thickness and length of the cable); if the speaker impedance becomes very low the resistance of the speaker wire may no longer be insignificant. To prevent this problem, the cross sectional area of the speaker cable conductor must double for each halving of speaker load impedance! In other words, running 2 ohm loads means using VERY heavy speaker cables (especially so if they are of significant length) in order to avoid losing costly audio power in the speaker cables. \r\nDamping Factor degradation: Using super low impedance loads on an amplifier will degrade the system's damping factor (discussed in detail below). Degradation of damping factor means that the amplifier will have less control over the speaker system, possibly resulting in a degradation of the sound quality.",

    "body": "Bi-amplification is (in most cases) defined as using more than one amplifier to power a speaker system (typically one amp for bass and one for mid/high frequencies). The key point here is that each amplifier is dedicated to a specific frequency band (whereas with single amplifier systems the one amp covers the entire audio range).  Similarly, some systems are tri-amplified and once in a while you may see a 4 or 5 way system (although the latter is usually reserved for only the most powerful touring type sound systems). Bi-amplification has many significant benefits:\nLower Distortion By using a separate amp for bass and a separate amp for mid/highs, the bass amp can clip without adversely impacting the overall sound quality. Chances are that the ugly sounding distortion produced by clipping an amp will not sound as bad coming out of a woofer (because woofers don't reproduce the high frequency distortion signals very well). Note that this means you should not consider clipping a good thing, it's just that the impact won't be as bad. \r\nMore total output Let's say you have a 400 watt single amp and 300 watt bass amp and 100 watt high/mid amp for use in a bi-amped configuration. You will be (in most cases) be able to get a higher volume out of the bi-amped system as compared to the single 400 watt system. Why is this? Isn't the total power the same for both setups? It is. However, due to the nature of musical waveforms, you'll be better able to handle large peak signals better. For example a loud bass sound and a loud HF sound at the same time may require a signal level that would clip the 400 watt amp. However, because in the bi-amp system the signal is split into different frequency bands, there's a better chance of handling the signal without clipping. Note that you can't expect to get a large amount of increase in sound level by using bi-amped systems, but in general you will get somewhat more capacity and at the same time significantly reduced levels of distortion. \r\nBetter Crossover performance The bad news is that bi-amplification requires that the signals to the amps be split into low and high bands BEFORE they are input to the amp. This requires what is called an electronic or active crossover network. The bad news is that this means more money, more wiring and more chances for problems if you don’t hook it up correctly.  However, the advantages of a bi or tri amped system make it the only choice for high power high performance systems.  Using an electronic crossover eliminates the need for large, expensive, lossy and non linear passive low frequency crossovers in bass systems. Elimination of passive crossovers (in the speaker cabinets) can significantly increase the quality of the sound!  Also, it is easy to design steep slope crossovers using active electronics, allowing for very sharp cutoff of lows and highs (a good thing for HF systems). Also, most active crossovers allow one to adjust the crossover frequency, adjust the level of the signal and vary the phase. For high power systems, bi-amplification is the norm (and tri-amplification is not at all uncommon). ",

Noise can be random or white noise with no coherence, or coherent noise introduced by the device's mechanism or processing algorithms.\r\nIn electronic recording devices, a major form of noise is hiss caused by random electrons that, heavily influenced by heat, stray from their designated path. These stray electrons influence the voltage of the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\r\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise.\r\nTo compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.\r\nMany noise reduction algorithms tend to damage more or less signals.

A stronger Luminance signal indicates a more intense brightness of light at a given spot on the screen. \r\nChrominance describes the frequency of light at a given point on the screen, or in more common terms, the color of the light to be produced at a given point. The Chrominance signal specifies what color is to be shown at a given point on the display as well as how saturated or intense the shade of color that is shown. Combinations of Red, Green and Blue light produced by the video display are able to deceive the human eye into perceiving the full range of visible colors, even though only three narrow ranges of frequencies in the visible spectrum can actually be generated by the video display. (This is reasonable, since the human eye only detects light frequencies centered around what we perceive as Red, Green and Blue, although human sensitivity to wavelengths of light is greater than the narrow wavelengths that the typical video display generates.) \r\nTogether, Luminance indicates how bright a given location on the screen is, and Chrominance specifies how close to not having a color (just being White), or how intense the shade of color at the brightness specified by the Luminance should be.",

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\r\nGet visibly involved.\r\nBe accessible to employees.\r\nSet a positive example.\r\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\r\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\r\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\r\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\r\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\r\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\r\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\r\n1.\r\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\r\n2.\r\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\r\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\r\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\r\n3.\r\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\r\n4.\r\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\r\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\r\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\r\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\r\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\r\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\r\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\r\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\r\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\r\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\r\nTo set a good example, you must:\r\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\r\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\r\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\r\nGet visibly involved.\r\nBe accessible to employees.\r\nSet a positive example.\r\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\r\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\r\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\r\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\r\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\r\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\r\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\r\n1.\r\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\r\n2.\r\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\r\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\r\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\r\n3.\r\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\r\n4.\r\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\r\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\r\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\r\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\r\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\r\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\r\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\r\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\r\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\r\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\r\nTo set a good example, you must:\r\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\r\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\r\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \r\n1.Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \r\n\r\n2. Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3. When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4. Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5. If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6. Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7. When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \r\n\r\n8. Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \r\n\r\n9. Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10. Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11. Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12. When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13. If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14. Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15. While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16. When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17. The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18. While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19. Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20. When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21. Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22. Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23. Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components.

It is used with an antenna. The antenna intercepts radio waves (electromagnetic waves) and converts them to tiny alternating currents which are applied to the receiver, and the receiver extracts the desired information. The receiver uses electronic filters to separate the desired radio frequency signal from all the other signals picked up by the antenna, an electronic amplifier to increase the power of the signal for further processing, and finally recovers the desired information through demodulation.\nThe information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound, images, or data.[1] A radio receiver may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. Radio receivers are components of communications, broadcasting, remote control, and network systems. In consumer electronics, the terms radio and radio receiver are often used specifically for receivers designed to reproduce sound transmitted by radio broadcasting stations, historically the first mass-market commercial radio application.",

(e.g. Welding screens can be used to isolate welding operations from other workers. Barriers and/or boundary lines can be used to separate areas where forklifts operate near pedestrians in the workplace.)\r\n• Safeguards - Safeguards can be added by modifying tools or equipment, or fitting guards to machinery. These must never be removed or disabled by workers using the equipment.\r\n• Instructing workers in the safest way to do something - This means developing and enforcing safe work procedures. Students on work experience must be given information and instruction and must follow agreed procedures to ensure their safety.\r\n• Using personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) - If risks remain after the options have been tried, it may be necessary to use equipment such as safety glasses, gloves, helmets and ear muffs. PPE can protect you from hazards associated with jobs such as handling chemicals or working in a noisy environment.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it will require more than one of the risk control measures above to effectively reduce exposure to hazards.\r\n",

The list of suitable equipment includes test lamps, such as the Drummond MTL10 or MTL20, or a two-pole voltage detector, such as the Martindale VI13800.\nIt is important to note that the voltage indicator must be able to work without the need for a battery, if you are using a device that needs a battery in order to work and the battery is flat, then you will not be able to prove if the circuit is dead or not!\r\nThe procedure for proving dead is to take your voltage indicator and check it against a known source, such as a proving unit, then test the circuit, then test your voltage indicator against your known source again to prove the tester has not failed during the test.\r\nWhilst you can use a known live source to test your voltage indicator, we would recommend using a dedicated proving unit. The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\r\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

This value is twice the maximum or peak value of the sine wave and is sometimes used for measurement ofac voltages. Note the difference between peak and peak-to-peak valuesin figure below. Usually alternating voltage and current are expressed in effective values rather than in peak-to-peak values.\n\r\nInstantaneous Value:The instantaneous value of an alternating voltage or current is the value of voltage or current at one particular instant. The value may be zero if the particular instant is the time in the cycle at which the polarity of the voltage is changing. It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\r\n\r\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\r\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation. Since the voltage increases from zero to peak value and decreases back to zero during one alternation, the average value must be some value between those two limits.",

    "body": "1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\r\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \r\n\r\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \r\n\r\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\r\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\r\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\r\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\r\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\r\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\r\n1.\r\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\r\n2.\r\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\r\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\r\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\r\n3.\r\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\r\n4.\r\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\r\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\r\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\r\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\r\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\r\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\r\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\r\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\r\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\r\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\r\nTo set a good example, you must:\r\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\r\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\r\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \r\n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \r\n\r\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \r\n\r\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \r\n\r\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

To use it, simply hole it up the the joint you want to remove solder from and hold a soldering iron up to it. It should soak up the solder fairly quickly. If not, then you probably have poor quality solder wick. If you do, you can doctor it up with some flux like this. Just add flux to the portion of the braid you'll be using before you put it on the joint. You can also add fresh solder to the solder joint beforehand to help a bit if the joint does not have a lot of solder to begin with.",

Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement. ",

The reason is that the known live source will only light some of the LEDs on the tester, whereas a proving unit will ensure that all LEDs on all ranges are working, again safeguarding against incorrect readings due to a blown LED. In addition, there may not be a known live source near the area you are working, so by having a proving unit with you, you’ll never have this problem.\r\nVoltage indicators should be proved using a known source both before and after testing the circuit.",

It means that the capacitor has a value of 10pF with a multiplier of 3 (means multiply by 1000). So the actual value of the capacitor is 10000pF or 0.01µF.   ",

It may also be the same as the peak value, if the selected instant is the time in the cycle at which the voltage or current stops increasing and starts decreasing.There are actually an infinite number of instantaneous values between zero and the peak value.\r\n\r\n1.6 AVERAGE VALUE\r\nThe average value of an alternating current or voltage is the average of all the instantaneous values during one alternation. Since the voltage increases from zero to peak value and decreases back to zero during one alternation, the average value must be some value between those two limits.",

    "body": "1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \n\r\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \r\n\r\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \r\n\r\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n24.          Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application. ",

How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\r\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\r\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\r\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\r\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\r\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\r\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\r\n1.\r\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\r\n2.\r\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\r\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\r\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\r\n3.\r\nFormal inspections. If you understand the difference between safe and unsafe practices, you can better contribute to the inspection. When in doubt concerning safety matters, defer to the judgment of the safety manager. Then make a point of filling the holes in your safety knowledge, so you will know the answer the next time. When making formal inspections, you should:\r\n4.\r\noInvolve other managers, supervisors, and employees.\r\noAccompany safety inspection teams on formal inspections.\r\noStop, look, listen, and observe. Stop moving through the area. Look for problems with equipment guards, access limitations, fall hazards, Code violations, and other dangers associated with the environment of the worker, rather than just the actions of the worker. Listen for potential dangers. Observe work methods for safe and unsafe practices.\r\noTake notes, and follow up after the inspection.\r\nBe accessible to employees. Employees should be able to ask you questions and make informal comments about safety issues and concerns. Your willingness to listen attentively and respond appropriately is a major incentive for employees to put safety first. You can be accessible by:\r\nTaking extra time during safety inspections to listen to workers.\r\nHaving an open-door policy so employees can drop by and discuss safety concerns without fear of reprisal. Employees should not have to make appointments for such meetings. Meetings should be casual so employees are comfortable and feel encouraged to make use of the policy.\r\nHolding weekly informal lunch meetings between senior managers and eight to 10 workers to discuss safety issues. A different group of managers and workers could participate each week. Such small group meetings can stimulate positive and constructive dialogue between workers and top management.\r\nSet a positive example. Countless studies show the manager's example sets the tone for the employee. Let's look at two examples. Manager A is aggressive and well respected for his ability to get the job done. He has a no-nonsense approach to business, focuses on the tasks at hand, and has high expectations from his work force. Although he claims to be a strong proponent of the safety program, he thinks only certain safety requirements are necessary. On various occasions, others have observed him cross barriers without the prescribed respiratory protection or other protective equipment. He feels justified in not complying with respiratory-protection requirements because he understands his operations and knows when hazards are present. His work force sees him disregard safety requirements, and they behave according to his example.\r\nManager B also supports the facility safety program. She participates in safety meetings and sets annual safety performance goals for her subordinate managers. Manager B effectively delegates many of her management duties to subordinates. Her ability to delegate improves her operations and allows her to frequently interact with all her employees on safety and health matters, and other issues of concern to them. As a result, her employees are used to seeing her in their workplace and feel comfortable discussing issues with her. Subordinate managers realize Manager B is likely to discover a safety problem and hold them accountable for it, so they maintain a state of readiness. Because Manager B is aware of safety requirements and is always attentive to safety concerns, her employees rarely engage in unsafe work practices.\r\nTo set a good example, you must:\r\nKnow the rules. For example, if you are signing a confined space permit, can you explain to each worker what his or her responsibilities are for that confined space? Can you clearly explain lockout/tagout rules without looking them up? If not, why not? If you don't know the rules, you can't expect your employees to understand them. If they don't understand them, how can they follow them? If you don't know them, how can you enforce them?\r\nFollow the rules exactly. Once you start modifying the rules, you erode their value. It doesn't take many instances of simply interpreting the rules or claiming something is a special situation before the rules become irrelevant to the workers. This happened with confined space entry in an extrusion plant. For years, management had waived so many requirements that, in practice, all the workers did was fill out a tag and affix it to the entryway. A new manager had a very difficult time enforcing confined space entry, because the employees weren't used to being held accountable.\r\nMake sure your subordinate managers, peer managers, and higher managers follow the rules. Your position allows you to tell subordinate managers they must comply. With peers, you will need to use tools of persuasion rather than authority. With upper managers, you'll need to explain their support makes it easier for you to enforce the rules. Honest communication, handled properly, should gain you the cooperation you need.",

    "body": "You can use the following strategies to demonstrate your personal commitment to safety:\nLearn how to be safe.\r\nGet visibly involved.\r\nBe accessible to employees.\r\nSet a positive example.\r\nAs we look at each of these strategies in greater depth and discuss specific techniques for applying them, think about potentially dangerous situations you have encountered in the workplace. How could you have applied these concepts in those instances? You might want to make a list of such situations as you go.\r\nLearn how to be safe. A solid understanding of safety rules and concepts forms the foundation for everything else you do in safety management. Unfortunately, procedures describing safety responsibilities are often exhaustive and needlessly complicated. Learning them may require consulting several manuals. Your company can overcome these barriers to understanding safety requirements by:\r\nOffering site-specific supervisor safety training.\r\nCompiling supervisor safety responsibilities into concise handbooks for easy reference.\r\nObtaining outside materials developed specifically for managers and supervisors.\r\nEstablishing a policy of interactive, one-on-one training. This involves asking people specific questions about their safety efforts and showing them where to improve.\r\nGet visibly involved. Your employees learn by example. If they don't see you practicing good safety habits, they won't think safety is important. Your visible involvement in safety activities demonstrates this importance and motivates employees to take a greater interest in their own safety. Some ways you can make your commitment more visible include:\r\n1.\r\nInformal worksite visits. These must be part of your routine. Frequent visits demonstrate a constant concern for safety. Infrequent visits give the impression of inconsistent attention to safety — as though it's an afterthought. When performing worksite visits, you should:\r\n2.\r\noLook for risky shortcuts that workers take to speed production or save time. For example, they may use a 6-ft ladder instead of taking the time to locate the 8-ft ladder required for the job.\r\noCompliment people on their use of safe work practices. For example, when a worker is using a correctly sized ladder you can say: “I notice you are using one of our rare 8-ft ladders instead of a 6-ft ladder for this task. I appreciate your taking the extra time to do the job correctly — and safely.”\r\noCorrect hazardous conditions and practices on the spot or as soon as possible. For example, if you find a damaged portable cord, stop whatever you are doing and replace it.\r\n3.\r\nFormal inspections.

    "body": "Application of troubleshooting technique\nThe following are the techniques in performing pre-testing of electronically-controlled domestic appliances. \r\n1.    Conduct a prompt diagnosis of the trouble symptom and repair the defective set in the shortest possible time. Do not troubleshoot any electronically-controlled domestic appliances unless you have determined what the fault is. Locate the fault from the mechanical section or electrical circuit section. \r\n\r\n2.     Wear cotton gloves while troubleshooting, to avoid the electrical shock. Also note that, especially in tropical countries, sweat on the hands may later on cause corrosion. \r\n\r\n3.     When troubleshooting in the electrical circuit section, never remove a component for testing. Before doing this, first measure the voltage. If the reading is abnormal, analyze the circuit and check which component may be causing the trouble and should be tested. \r\n\r\n4.    Discharge large capacitors by connecting a jumper wire across their two conducting terminals. \r\n\r\n5.    If the trouble symptom is caused by aging components, the defective component is usually one of them. But in some cases, especially in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to malfunction. \r\n\r\n6.    Know the usual defects of components. For example, capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open. Resistors increase their resistance when they become defective. Semi-conductors such as transistors usually become open or shorted. \r\n\r\n7.    When troubleshooting integrated circuits (ICs) in the electrical circuit section of a domestic appliance, do not remove the IC from the PCB, simply because you suspect it is defective. To help you diagnose the function of the IC, secure a circuit diagram from the manufacturer. It would be even better if you have available diagram showing the internal connection of the IC. \r\n\r\n8.    Always be careful about the polarity of the components when replacing them. Electrolytic capacitors used in transistors or integrated circuits have only low voltages. \r\n\r\n9.    Do not remove components from the PCB. Every component has a specific function in the circuit; there is absolutely no wasted component. Always analyze the specific function of every component in the circuit. \r\n\r\n10.          Don’t replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have corrected the trouble or the cause of it. \r\n\r\n11.          Always suspect a faulty contact on mechanical switch circuit rather than defective electronic components. \r\n\r\n12.          When replacing the resistor (SCR/TRIAC) the replacement should have the same current rating. \r\n\r\n13.          If you find a blown fuse, first find the cause of the short circuit before replacing it. If you cannot find the cause, replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same rating. If the glass of the blown fuse is clear, or if the conductor inside the fuse is neatly cut, assume an overload has caused it. In this case, the trouble maybe complicated. If the glass of the blown fuse is black, or if the conductor inside has melted, assume the short circuit is due to extremely strong electric current. \r\n\r\n14.          Use needle-pointed probes for better contact and to avoid short circuiting nearby components. \r\n\r\n15.          While troubleshooting, study the schematic diagram carefully. Always compare with the actual measured voltage in the set the voltage indicated on the circuit diagram. A difference of around 10% between the measured voltage and the ideal diagramed voltage is tolerable, but not more than 10%. \r\n\r\n16.          When measuring resistances in the circuit, make sure that power is not being supplied on the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-meter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter. \r\n\r\n\r\n17.          The functions and the characteristics of the VOM should be wisely used. \r\n\r\n18.          While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the higher meter reading as the approximate resistance. \r\n\r\n19.          Prepare only the tools and measuring instrument needed for servicing electric fan. Not all electronic tools are needed and useful all the time. \r\n\r\n20.          When using the measuring equipment, first read carefully the user’s manual. Analyze carefully the readings of measurements you have obtained. \r\n\r\n21.          Use soldering irons with the proper power rating to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. The soldering iron tips should be clean and preferably slim. Soldering guns are not recommended for beginners, since it is difficult to keep their temperatures constant. \r\n\r\n22.          Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting printed circuit boards. Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. \r\n\r\n23.          Dry solder joints are hard to detect. However, when they are found or suspected, remove the components from the PCB; then file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating dry joints with a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off. \r\n\r\n       24. Select a soldering iron with the rating appropriate for the particular application.",

They use have different tips for different types of components.",

You use a soldering iron to heat the joint up and then use a can of compressed air to blow the solder off. This is rather messy and I would only recommend doing this on a board that you are salvaging parts from because you can end up with solder where you don't want it. It is rather crude, but it works.

    "body": "Step 9: The Hard Way\n \r\nIf all you have is a soldering iron and some solder, you can still remove parts, it's just much harder than all the other methods I've shown. Adding fresh solder to the joints is really your friend here. It will really help when trying to desolder components with three or more leads. Sometimes it's hard to heat them all up fast enough but adding flux and a good amount of fresh solder to connect the leads will speed things up. There are low temperate solder wires available like ChipQuik that you can use specifically use to help remove components. In place of solder wire, you can use low temperature solder paste to speed up the desoldering process even more. It is often in an easy to use syringe for quick placement. ",
